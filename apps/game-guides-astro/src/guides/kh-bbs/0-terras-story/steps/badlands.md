|  Terra immediately initiates the Dark Impulse Command Style to start the    |
| battle and will continue to unleash it through out the fight. Master Eraqus |
| takes half damage from these attacks however, they provide you speedy and   |
| stunning attacks that keep you on the offensive. When Eraqus uses some of   |
| his longer charged up attacks take the time to heal. You can block basically|
| everything that you are attacked with so take advantage of it. Remember that|
| you can't use any D-Links during this fight so keep all your healing spells |
| in the deck and keep on the offensive to win the fight.                     |
