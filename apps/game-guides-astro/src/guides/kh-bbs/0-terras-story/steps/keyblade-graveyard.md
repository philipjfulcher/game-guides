## Xehanort

After the opening scene open the three chests for the [KEYBLADE GRAVEYARD MAP]
a [MEGA-POTION], and an [ELIXIR]. Head out to the Twister Trench and be swept
away by each tornado. Clear them for massive experience and command points as
well as a safe journey through the area, but be wary as they are difficult. The
Mandrakes are particularly bothersome, be sure to jump over their blade attacks.
Find all four chests to obtain a [MEGA-POTION], [WINDCUTTER], [MEGALIXIR], and
a [MEGA-ETHER]. The final sticker is near the central pillar, a [TRAFFIC CONE
STICKER] high in the air. At the other end of the trench is the Fissure where
a Shop and Save Point greet you. This is the last save of the game before the
finale, continue to the next area when you are ready.

## Unversed Mission - Launching Plant

Location: Seat of War
Reward: Illusion L
1 Star: 0-200
2 Star: 201-349
3 Star: 350+

The Launching Plant will drop orbs when hit after being launched. You'll need
to deliver a lot of hits quickly so Surge attacks work best. For Terra, use
Thunder Surge constantly to launch the Unversed into the air then follow up with
a leaping Thunder Surge for large hits. The Thunderbolt finisher is great for
getting a lot of orbs quickly.

|  For this fight it's best to just attack Vanitas. Once his HP reaches 50%   |
| the fight is over and he has the lesser of the two in the HP category. If   |
| you can stun or freeze Vanitas then it should make for a quick fight. In the|
| end this fight isn't that hard, if it does get rough simply D-Link or use   |
| your Shotlock to stay alive.                                                |

|  The next battle is against Master Xehanort himself as he sends Vanitas to  |
| go battle elsewhere. Xehanort will warp around when ever you get close to   |
| him and then generally appears behind Terra and starts a combo. You can     |
| avoid this and counter with your own combo for decent damage. When you are  |
| given distance use that opportunity to Shotlock or heal depending on your   |
| situation. Xehanort will charge up a few attacks that can be devastating    |
| such as a swarm of Keyblades, hit him with a Strike Raid style attack or a  |
| Shotlock to disrupt him because these types of attacks will leave you       |
| crippled. Take advantage of short warps for easy combos and keep the heat on|
| Master Xehanort to end the battle.                                          |

|  Xehanort steals Terra's body in this fight and you are unable to use any   |
| D-Links. Stick to your guns, use standard combinations and commands to win  |
| this final battle. Right off the bat you will be assault by a Dark Volley   |
| so be sure to dodge it. Counter and combo, heal when you get a breather.    |
| Shotlock when Xehanort is charging up attacks, otherwise don't bother trying|
| because you will just get interrupted. Stick it out to finish Terra's Story.|
