Before you even make it to this world Terra will encounter numerous Jellyshade
Unversed. Fight them off with X and Triangle until you are taken to a cutscene.

| PRIZES   |
| -------- | ------------- |
| POWER UP | Maximum HP Up |

After the scene Terra is thrust into combat again with the Unversed. Hop on
to the elevator and open the door nearby to find a chest with [HIGH JUMP],
equip this immediately. Use High Jump to continue south along the wall. At the
top platform is a chest with a [MEGA-POTION] and across from here is another
chest with [BRUTAL BLAST] and drop off to reach the [FLYING BALLOON STICKER] and
on the north side a chest with a [MEGA-ETHER] inside. Ride the first elevator up
and go north this time to find a chest with a [PULSING CRYSTAL], then drop down
and exit via the north gate.

## Rescue Experiment 626

Here you can save your game if you choose. Open the chest in the side room for
the [DEEP SPACE MAP] then examine the transporter. Open the chest for a [HI-
POTION] and defeat the Unversed. Proceed north and defeat the enemies here then
exit at the north end. In this room you will be getting shot at by turrets, take
them out before the Unversed. When the floor is clear collect the two chests for
[ABOUNDING CRYSTAL] and [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]. Jump up and exit at the eastern
door to find a [MINE SQUARE] in a chest as well as a save point.

Head back to the Launch Deck and examine the terminal. You can now jump very
high so make your way to the western exit, but not after getting the [THUNDARA]
from the chest above the eastern exit. Turn gravity back on and slowly descend
as you collect three chests containing [MEGA-POTION], [HUNGRY CRYSTAL], and
[FLEETING CRYSTAL] then exit near the bottom. Open the chest in the Control Room
for a [HI-POTION] and utilize the Shop and Save Point. In the Ship Corridor you
can snag two more treasures, [HI-POTION] and an [ETHER], and the [UFO STICKER].
Go through the center section to face a boss.

| Experiment 221 uses a lot of Thunder attacks so having Thunder Screen can |
| be useful on harder difficulties. Stack a few Blizzard based abilities and |
| activate the Diamond Dust Command Style to inflict some good damage. Halfway|
| through the fight Experiment 221 will utilize Robotic Arms in the center of |
| the battlefield. You can dodge the attacks they launch at you or simply use |
| a Shotlock to annihilate the arms and bring Experiment 221 back down in a |
| stunned state. |

Return to Deep Space after the scenes and get back to the Ship Corridor. Loot
the previously inaccessible [WARP] and [PULSING CRYSTAL] from the chests to get
100% completion. Head to Never Land once you are done.

## Unversed Mission - Jelly Glee Tea ##

Location: Launch Deck
Reward: Stun Block / Stop Barrier
1 Star: 0-50 Orbs
2 Star: 51-89 Orbs
3 Star: 90-100 Orbs

The trick to collecting enough orbs is to Counter the Jelly Glee Tea and
use powerful commands like Meteor Crash and Chaos Blade. This challenge is much
like the Struggle battles in Kingdom Hearts 2, so you must collect the orbs as
you knock them loose. Once you collect 90+ just run around until time expires.
