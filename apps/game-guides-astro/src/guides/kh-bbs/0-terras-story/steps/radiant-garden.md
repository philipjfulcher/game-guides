## Tracking Vanitas

Terra is thrown in to combat immediately against Unversed. Two new enemies
have shown their face this time around, the Tank Topper and the Chrono Twister.
The Tank Topper will become invulnerable once hit and will explode for massive
damage, unless it's immobilized via Magnet, Stop, Zero Gravity or hit from the
back (it's valve). The Chrono Twister will cast Stopga on Terra and essentially
spell doom on harder difficulty levels. The best way to avoid this is to make
the Chrono Twisters your priority with high level attacks such as Fission Firaga
or Mega Flare (if you melded it already).

Search for two chests holding [HI-POTION] and [POTION] then use the jump and
swing technique to grab the [FLYING BALLOON STICKER]. Exit at the eastern end
to view a scene of Merlin, afterwards examine the book to unlock [THE HUNDRED-
ACRE WOODS] Command Board. Open the chest for a [SHIMMERING CRYSTAL] then leave
to see a large Unversed pass nearby. Grab the [RADIANT GARDEN MAP] from the
chest and check out the shop if you need.

## Finding Old Friends

Go north to the Fountain Court and drop down to the base level. In one of the
corners by the steps will be Prize Pods, in the opposite end of the court is a
chest with a [PANACEA]. Use the fountains to make your way to the top of the
area. At the middle area you can drop off to the right to reach the top right
corner of the map where two chests are located containing [FLEETING CRYSTAL] and
[THUNDER SURGE]. Unfortunately, you can't reach the [DALE STICKER] right now so
continue onward to the Aqueduct.

Climb to the top of the Aqueduct and open the chest for [BLACKOUT] and an
[ESUNA]. Further down the tunnel you will find another chest with a [HI-POTION]
inside. Load up on some high attack commands in preparation for the boss in the
next area then make your way to it.

|  Ventus and Aqua make an appearance here but don't help out too much in     |
| combat. Focus on taking out the legs first with high level commands or the  |
| Shotlock. Move on to the arms only after the legs have been dealt with and  |
| watch out for the sweeping energy beams. You can dash through them to get   |
| behind the boss and deal some good close range damage. Trinity Armor will   |
| separate itself after the first wave of energy beams, be sure to keep your  |
| distance so that you can dodge the barrage of attacks. Once the limbs are   |
| gone pummel the body to end the fight.                                      |

After the fight everyone goes their own separate ways. Make your way back to
the Central Square and travel south to the Outer Gardens. There are two chests
with [FIRA] and [PULSING CRYSTAL] inside, but you can't reach the [AIRPLANE
STICKER] near the gate. Go through the middle section to reach the Purification
Facility and make sure you have a good healing spell equipped.

|  You begin this fight with Braig targeting you with his gun. Once you get   |
| the timing down you can deflect the bullets back at him with a successful   |
| Block. If you can't block them you can always dash around to avoid them.    |
| After a few shots Braig will come down to fight you close-range. Listen for |
| him to shout "Reload!" and unleash your best commands on him otherwise use  |
| your Shotlock and other commands. Use the long-range phase to heal yourself |
| if you start to get low on health.                                          |

After the scene return to the Radiant Garden and go back to where you just
fought Braig. Loot the two chests for [MEGA-POTION] and [CHAOS CRYSTAL]. Three
more worlds have opened up but it is recommended to go to Disney Town first.

## Unversed Mission - Diet Tank

Location: Outer Gardens
Reward: Illusion D
1 Star: 2'00"00+
2 Star: 1'00"00 - 1'59"59
3 Star: 0'00"00 - 0'59"59

The objective is to shrink the Diet Tank by hitting the valve on the back.
Load up with Thunder Surge commands then start the challenge. The Diet Tank will
shoot up into the air, just lock on and Guard but don't use a counter. Instead
use a Thunder Surge to deal massive damage and force the Diet Tank back into
the air. Chase it down and keep using a Guard -> Thunder Surge combo to win.
