## Becoming a Hero

Ventus is thrust in to combat as soon as he arrives. Hercules and a masked
soldier assist as you fight two new enemies; Axe Flappers can fly and fire
Mandrake-like projectiles and Buckle Bruisers that block all attacks from the
front. Once all the Unversed have been disposed of and scenes are over head to
the Coliseum Gates. Grab the three chests treasures, [MEGA-POTION], [CURA], and
a [FIRE STRIKE] as well as the [CONFETTI STICKER] then enter the Vestibule to
find the [OLYMPUS COLISEUM MAP] in another chest.

Talk to Hercules to start training, it's the mini-game Break the Urns! In the
initial round you must score 15 in 30 seconds. In the second round you must out
score Hercules. The easiest way to do this is area of effect attacks and the
use of elemental attacks to trigger Command Styles. Barrels are also helpful in
destroying the larger urns easier.

While Hercules and Zack are battling through the Coliseum a Jellyshade swarm
is attacking the town. Head out to the Town Near Thebes to find the swarm,
Hercules teams up with Ventus and you can use a button combo to quickly clear
some of them out.

After the scene you can return to the Coliseum and challenge Hercules again
to win the [SONIC BLADE] command. You can also fight the Prize Pods, located in
the southwest corner of the Town Near Thebes. Head over to Deep Space once you
have finished up.

## Unversed Mission - Shade Jelly

Location: Town Near Thebes
Reward: Stopga
1 Star: 1'00"00+
2 Star: 0'31"00 - 0'59"00
3 Star: 0'00"01 - 0'30"59

The trick here is to defeat all 300 Shade Jelly using clearing commands like
Magnega and Meteor, Mega Flare, Thundaga, etc... There really isn't much else to
it, just stack some heavy commands and go to town.
