## Whistle While You Work

After the scene switch out Quick Blitz for Sliding Dash and grab the three
chests in this area for two [POTIONS] and an [ETHER]. Head north in to the mine
and begin the chase with the dwarves. Most of them are in crates, Bashful is the
exception and he rides the cart on the west end of the mine. Hit the back of the
cart to reveal the last dwarf. Grab the [BALLOON STICKER] and three chests
containing a [PAYBACK RAID], [PANACEA], and [MINI] which is located high above
in the room.

Head south through the Mountain Trail until you reach the Cottage. Open the
chest inside to get the [ATTACK RECIPE] then head back to the clearing. The
chests here hold a [POISON], [DWARF WOODLANDS MAP], and a [FIRE]. You can reach
the [ICE CREAM STICKER] if you jump and swing the Keyblade at your peak. Go
south to the Deep Woods and open its three chests for an [ETHER], [POTION], and
[SHIMMERING CRYSTAL] then talk to Snow White. The mission is to escort her back
to the Cottage. Stick near her and when a Treant attacks use square to block and
X to counter and dispel the Treant.

| PRIZES   |
| -------- | ------------- |
| POWER UP | Maximum HP Up |

Stock up on some Potions and utilize the Save Point before heading in to the
Deep Woods to meet Ventus' first boss fight. You may also want to consider
playing the Command Board to get a new Shotlock, Ragnarok. It's located in the
top left corner for 800 GP and is well worth getting.

|  Start off this boss fight with a Shotlock then charge in with physical     |
| attacks to trigger the Command Style. When the Mad Treant jumps in the air  |
| you need to jump up when it's at its peak and attack to avoid the stunning  |
| shockwave when it lands and deal more damage. Be careful when comboing or   |
| you will find yourself caught in the Mad Treants barrage of mini-bombs that |
| it will throw out in a short-range circle. If you get low on health use a   |
| D-Link or a Potion. Aqua has healing magic while Terra will help you take   |
| the Treant down faster.                                                     |

After the scenes you are taken back to the World Map. Head back to the Dwarf
Woodlands via the Cottage Clearing and go south till you reach the Flower Glade.
At the southern tip of the map is a chest with a [SOOTHING CRYSTAL]. You can
also find the Prize Pods in the eastern loop of the Mine if they spawn. When you
are all finished head to the Castle of Dreams.

## Unversed Mission - Survival Bottle

Location: The Mine
Reward: Illusion S
1 Star: 0'00"00 - 0'59"59
2 Star: 1'00"00 - 1'59"59
3 Star: 2'00"00+

The trick here is to load up on a bunch of Cure commands and have a long
Shotlock like Meteor Shower or Ragnarok so you can reach the Survival Bottle.
The poison will kill you quickly so chase down the Survival Bottle and use
Finishers often since you are immune during them (same with Shotlocks). Use a
Cure when you can't reach the Survival Bottle in time and roll to keep up. Just
watch out when the Survival Bottle dashes at you, Guard then counter!
