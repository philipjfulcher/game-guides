## Waking Aurora

Ventus begins in Aurora's Chamber where you can utilize a save point and shop.
Head in to the Tower Room to find a chest containing [SLEEP] then head in to the
Hallway. Grab the [HI-POTION] from the chest on your way to the Audience Chamber
where you will find this world's Prize Pods. In the corners of the room you will
find a [THUNDER] and a [HI-POTION], then head past the Bridge to the Forest
Clearing. Grab the [ENCHANTED DOMINION MAP] and move on to the Waterside.

There is a [POTION] in a chest in this area, other than that continue to the
Forbidden Mountain where you will find another singular chest with an [ETHER].
Climb up the long ramp to finally reach the Gates. Maleficent's Henchman aren't
that big of a deal with the exception of the archers, make sure to single them
out before taking on any other enemies. There are two chests you can reach at
this moment containing the [ABSOLUTE ZERO SHOTLOCK] and a [CURE].

In the next area, Maleficent's Throne, Ventus is surrounded by Henchman. Use
a D-Link if your health gets low and focus on the archers to get out of this one
alive. Grab a [HI-POTION] from the chest then continue on to the Hall, a curious
room with lots of portals. Head to the first blue spiral which leads you to an
orange spiral. Exit here in to the Dungeon but try not to fall, it's a long way
back and you can get frustrated if you don't know how to. Use your Shotlock to
take out the enemies on the floor and use a dash command to reach the chest
along the left wall for a [TORNADO STRIKE]. The chest across the smaller gap
holds a [FLEETING CRYSTAL].

Exit on this side back in to the Hall. Open the first chest for a [HI-POTION]
then fight your way to the green spiral which leads to two more chests filled
with a [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL] and a [HUNGRY CRYSTAL]. Return to the Dungeon and
drop down this time exiting at the southern area. Find the spiral and examine it
when it's purple to reach the final chest with a [MAGNET] and the [CONFETTI
STICKER]. Go back and examine the spiral when it turns yellow this time and then
take the red spiral to Aurora's Heart. Head in to Maleficent's Throne to fight
her off.

|  Maleficent will shoot lightning attacks at you and depending on where she  |
| stands she can reach you anywhere. While she is trying to hit you with this |
| attack you can Shotlock her for some good damage. When Maleficent stops in  |
| the center of the area she will summon waves that will put Ventus to sleep. |
| Utilize the fairies at this time by entering a button command when they make|
| a ring of light. This will stun Maleficent allowing you to do some good     |
| damage. If you give her enough space she will turn into a swirling spiral of|
| death, be sure to dodge this attack until she's finished.                   |

After the scene head back to the Enchanted Dominion and return to the Gates.
Climb up the newly formed rubble to find two chests with a [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]
and a [BALLOON LETTER]. In the northwest you can climb up to find a chest with
a [SOOTHING CRYSTAL] inside. Leave this world and head to the area marked "???"
prepared for a fight.

## Unversed Mission - Flaming Box

Location: Waterside
Reward: Firaga
1 Star: 0-14
2 Star: 15-29
3 Star: 30+

Start the challenge where a Flaming Box launches fireballs into the sky. You
must break them before they hit the ground. This is best done with simple
Keyblade strikes on single targets and Magnet/Zero Gravity on larger groups.
The longer you go the more fireballs will get launched simultaneously.

|  Don't bother about the first round except for doing all the damage that you|
| can and getting in some practice. King Mickey will jump in when either you  |
| or the Masked Boy reach 50% health. This boss is a little tricky in that he |
| will dodge your attacks and quickly counter. The key to this is when you see|
| a pause in his combat, he is creating a clone and warping behind you, be    |
| quick and you can dodge this attack. The upside to this fight is that you   |
| have Mickey to act as a punching bag for you and spells like Magnet or Zero |
| Gravity will suspend the Masked Boy making him vulnerable to whatever you   |
| want. Shotlock only when you have distance and Mickey is striking. Watch out|
| for the large ball of darkness that the Masked Boy can fire, it's damaging. |
