| PRIZES        |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| COMMAND BOARD | Toon Board (Disney Town) |

Return to Disney Town afterwards to collect all the treasures and play any
mini-games you would like. Every game has a rewarding prize, Ice Cream Beat has
the [FROZEN FORTUNE COMMAND STYLE], Fruitball has the [CHAOS SNAKE SHOTLOCK],
and Rumble Racing has the [VICTORY LINE KEYBLADE]. Loot the two chests in the
Main Plaza for the [DISNEY TOWN MAP] and a [POTION]. The [MINNIE STICKER] can't
be reached until later in the game so do down the manhole to the Gizmo Gallery.

## Through Gizmo Gallery

On the bottom floor you find two chests with [THUNDERS] inside. Near the
second chest is a machine that must be struck with thunder-based attacks. An
easy way to do this is enter the Ramuh's Judgment Command Style. Ride the
Mickey Mouse elevator up and jump over to two chests with a [MEGA-POTION] and a
[PULSING CRYSTAL]. Jump back on the elevator and on to the gears, then on to a
hand leading to another set of gears. Let the Mickey Mouse pusher retract then
run to the second hand and jump to the third and fourth off to the platform with
two chests containing [CHAOS CRYSTAL] and [MEGA-POTION].

Return to the same set of gears and jump this time to the rolling pin gears
at the south end to reach the final treasure chest of the area, a [HUNGRY
CRYSTAL], and the entrance to Pete's Rec Room. In this room Aqua becomes a
pinball; climb to the top of the steps and leap to the launcher. Bounce off the
bumpers and use the flippers with L and R to reach the chests in this area. Two
are in the alcove on the machine's left side, one is in the top right, and one
is in the each of the two center alcoves. There are bars that block this chest
but hitting the four blue bumpers with a crown will release them. The chests in
this area contain the [ACTION RECIPE], [PANACEA], [SOOTHING CRYSTAL], [AERIAL
SLAM], and [BREAK TIME].

Exit to the Raceway Rooftops and open the chest for a [SLOT EDGE]. Standing
on the southwest corner and looking down you can spot the [DAISY STICKER]. Jump
down and swing the Keyblade when you are near it to grab the sticker. If you
miss and really want it you can simply die and restart from the top, just be
sure to grab the slot edge again. The remaining chests in this area contain an
[ABOUNDING CRYSTAL] and [FIRA]. Once you are finished here head to the Olympus
Coliseum.

## Unversed Mission - Ringer Pot

Location: Raceway
Reward: Illusion P
1 Star: 0-19
2 Star: 20-39
3 Star: 40+

This is a pretty clean cut challenge, hit the right Ringer Pot and score
points for each Ringer Pot on the field -- hit the wrong one and gain one point
but lose 5 seconds. With High Jump this becomes much easier so you can get
up the ledges faster but this one simply takes practice.
