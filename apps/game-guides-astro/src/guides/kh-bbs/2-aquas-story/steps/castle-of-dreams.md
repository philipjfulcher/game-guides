## Searching for Clues

As Aqua arrives in the Castle of Dreams she runs in to Terra. Grab treasures
around the room for a [FLEETING CRYSTAL], [BARRIER SURGE], [POTION], and the
[THUNDERSTORM SHOTLOCK]. The [FIREWORKS STICKER] can also be found in the middle
of the top area near the steps. Enter the Ballroom to the north for a scene and
re-equip Aqua's Command Deck as you will be fighting enemies from here on out.
Thunderstorm should be equipped (or Ragnarok if you get it from the Command
Board) instead of Aqua's base Shotlock.

Head south through the Foyer and the Corridor in to the Palace Courtyard.
There are three chests here containing a [HI-POTION], [SLOW], and a [POTION].
The [BUBBLE STICKER] can be reached if you jump and swing the Keyblade at the
peak of your jump. If you can't reach it just get it later when you have High
Jump. South from here is the Forest, further down is The Chateau. Run around the
side and snag the [MAGIC RECIPE] from the chest then approach the front door.
Speak with the Fairy Godmother when you are ready to help out Jaq.

The objective is to escort Jaq to his hole. You can help him with square if
he is in danger but otherwise you need to defeat the Unversed quickly and keep
them away from him. Slow and Barrier Surge should aid you in keeping them off
Jaq.

|  The Cursed Coach is the first boss and will test your knowledge of Aqua,   |
| her strengths, and weaknesses. Equip a bunch of Magic Commands like Fire    |
| and Blizzard. Reflect Blitz is also a good technique, you can use it off    |
| the start to get some quick hits in. You'll want to utilize more of a hit   |
| and elude tactic with Aqua, her strength is in her Magic Commands not up in |
| the face of the enemy with the Keyblade. Her Shotlock is a great weapon for |
| this battle as well, you'll want to use it when the Cursed Coach is idling. |
|                                                                             |
|  Stay on your toes for the Cursed Coach's attack. You can use Barrier when  |
| facing the vine Whip or Vine Spin, countering with Reflect Blitz, but you   |
| will need to dodge the Bounce attack because the shockwaves cause damage.   |
| Cursed Coach may summon some Thornbites, just take care of them quickly or  |
| let them linger if you need some health, though you should resort to D-Link |
| for healing. The Pumpkin Bombs attack is one of the more powerful attacks   |
| as the Cursed Coach rises into the air dropping the bombs from overhead,    |
| use Cartwheel to avoid. Lastly, the Swallow attack should be Cartwheeled    |
| away from to avoid being consumed. If you are consumed, continually use the |
| attack button to free yourself.                                             |
|                                                                             |
|  As Cursed Coach's HP dwindles you'll stun it allowing for the "Turnover"   |
| command to score a bunch of HP balls. After this move is initiated the      |
| Cursed Coach normally whizzes around the battlefield, you'll need to dodge  |
| around for a bit to avoid taking too much damage. All-in-all, the battle    |
| isn't too difficult if you utilize Magic Commands, Shotlock, and Command    |
| Styles throughout the fight.                                                |
