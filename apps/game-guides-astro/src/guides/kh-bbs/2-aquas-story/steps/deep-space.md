## Showdown with Gantu

Aqua is again thrust into combat against the Unversed upon arrival. After the
battle Aqua is escorted to the Control Room. Loot the two chests in the Control
Room for an [ETHER] and [BALLOON LETTER] then enter the Ship's Corridor. Pass
through this area to return to the Durgon Transporter. Grab the [HI-POTION] from
the chest if you didn't earlier then head to the Ship's Exterior. Defeat the
Guidewinder's here to be taken back to the Durgon Transporter.

| ------- | --------- |
| COMMAND | Air Slide |

This time around use the transporter in the middle to reach the Turo
Transporter room. Get the [DEEP SPACE MAP] from the chest and head in to the
Turo Prison Block. You are thrust into battle again and Experiment 626 will aid
Aqua. She is taken back to the Control Room after the battle so make your way
back to the Turo Prisoner Block. Don't forget to equip Air Slide and run to the
south end to meet some Unversed. Defeating them spawns the Prize Pods of this
world.

| PRIZES   |
| -------- | ------------- |
| POWER UP | Maximum HP Up |

Take the elevator to the top and make your way around the room to find four
chests containing an [ABOUNDING CRYSTAL], [BLITZ], [TELEPORT], [MEGA-POTION],
and a [DALE STICKER]. Return to the Control Room and exit at the east door into
the Ship Hub. Drop down to the ground floor and open a chest for a [FIRE SURGE]
then activate the nearby terminal to release gravity. Jump up to the other
terminal and jump out to the center to reach the [UFO STICKER]. Activate the
terminal then jump to the side platform to find a chest containing the [PRISM
RAIN] Shotlock. Turn gravity off once more and jump to the top of the Ship Hub
and exit in to the Launch Deck.

|  Gantu typically opens with a blaster shot barrage. Long combo attacks like |
| Sonic Blade and Aerial Slam are extremely effective. Aqua can block most of |
| Gantu's attacks and when Experiment 626 turns into a ball grab him with     |
| square and hit X to spike him into Gantu's face. While they are locked up   |
| you can hit Gantu with anything you want. Just watch out when you get too   |
| close to Gantu, he'll charge and pummel you into the crates around the room |
| for additional damage. Fight safely from range and use Experiment 626 to    |
| get free shots in on Gantu.                                                 |

After the battle return to Deep Space to gather the remaining treasures. Head
to the Launch Deck and take out the turrets. There are two chests at the bottom
containing a [MEGA-ETHER] and [HUNGRY CRYSTAL]. Release gravity to reach a third
chest containing a [ZERO GRAVIRA] then turn gravity back on. Enter the Machinery
Bay Access to find the last chest with the [MEGA ATTACK RECIPE] inside. After
you are finished head to Never Land.

## Unversed Mission - Jelly Glee Tea

Location: Launch Deck
Reward: Stun Block / Stop Barrier
1 Star: 0-50 Orbs
2 Star: 51-89 Orbs
3 Star: 90-100 Orbs

The trick to collecting enough orbs is to Counter the Jelly Glee Tea and
use powerful commands like Meteor Crash and Chaos Blade. This challenge is much
like the Struggle battles in Kingdom Hearts 2, so you must collect the orbs as
you knock them loose. Once you collect 90+ just run around until time expires.
