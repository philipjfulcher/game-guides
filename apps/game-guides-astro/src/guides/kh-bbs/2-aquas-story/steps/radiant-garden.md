## The Group Reunited

After the opening scene open the chests for an [ETHER] and a [POTION]. Exit at
the western side into the Garden to find new Unversed such as the deadly
Mandrake that can attack with spinning green projectiles from a distance. The
Tank Topper is also a new foe, it will explode after taking enough damage and
becomes invulnerable during it's ticking time-bomb phase. If you hit it from the
back however you will release the tension it has built up, allowing you to kill
it. As you make your way to the top of the Garden be sure to loot the contents
of the four chests for a [ZERO GRAVITY], [STRIKE RAID], [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL],
and a [FLEETING CRYSTAL].

As you enter the Front Doors you will find Mickey Mouse battling a horde of
Unversed. Lend Mickey a hand and use the joint attack "Burst of Faith" to take
them out quickly. There are three more chests in this area containing a
[PANACEA], [RADIANT GARDEN MAP], and a [MINE SQUARE]. The [JUICE STICKER] can
be reached with a max level High Jump or a jump from the steps and dash command
combination.

|  This Unversed is similar to the Guard Armor from the original Kingdom      |
| Hearts and will be fought much the same. The Trinity Armor starts with all  |
| of its pieces connected as a single unit, during this phase it will use     |
| three attacks. The first is Fire Rain, where Trinity Armor shoots fireballs |
| into the sky that will land and explode on contact. The second is Charge, a |
| simple dash that is executed three times in a row and is best avoided with  |
| Barrier or Carthweel. Lastly, Trinity Armor will move to the center of the  |
| area and charge up a Trinity Laser that will deal a lot of damage. This     |
| attack is used in a sweeping motion, just Carthweel through the laser to    |
| avoid taking damage.                                                        |
|                                                                             |
|  Once the Trinity Laser has been used or you deal a lot of damage, the      |
| Trinity Armor breaks into pieces. Off the start they will all be spinning   |
| around in circles and this is a good time to use a Shotlock. The legs will  |
| stomp around, the arms fly around, and the head will shoot fireballs. Focus |
| on the arms and legs, they are easier to defeat. After some time the pieces |
| will regroup and use Trinity Laser again, then revert to being separate     |
| pieces. Remember to focus on a single piece until it is defeated then move  |
| onto the next, leaving the head for last.                                   |

After the battle Aqua has to make her way to the Central Square again. To get
there you have to go through the Aqueduct and Fountain Court areas. Don't miss
the [HI-POTION] in the early part of the Aqueduct or the three at the end with
a [BLOCK RECIPE], [THUNDARA], and [HI-POTION]. The [DONUT STICKER] can be
reached with a jump from the ledge and a swing of the Keyblade. In the Fountain
Court you will find two chests in the north east corner containing a [SOOTHING
CRYSTAL] and the [COUNTER BLAST]. Directly below here are some Blue Sea Salts
that can be defeated to spawn the Prize Pods of this world.

As you enter the Castle Town area you will meet Merlin. Don't miss the [FLOWER
STICKER] near the save point and be sure to use the shop to get any new commands
that you don't have. Enter Merlin's House and check the book to unlock a new
Command Board and open the chest for [XEHANORT'S REPORT 3]. Leave and go to the
Central Square where Aqua finds a surprise.

|  The Masked Boy is pretty aggressive and relentless but his status          |
| resistances make him easy prey for Aqua. Equip Ignite, Poison, Magnet,      |
| Blizzard, and Cure so you can take advantage of this foes weakness. Start   |
| off the battle with Ignite then switch to the defensive. You'll have to     |
| deal with the Sliding Dash that the Masked Boy uses, it can be blocked with |
| Barrier. The Crawling Fire attack is very slow moving but should likewise   |
| be blocked. The Lightning Bolt attack see the Masked Boy move high into the |
| air, when this happens you'll want to dodge. Lastly, the Masked Boy has a   |
| tendency to leave an after image when struck and he will counter by warping |
| behind you so be ready to guard.                                            |
|                                                                             |
|  It's not hard to dodge the attacks and when you do the Masked Boy is wide  |
| open for a combo or a magic attack. Magnet is nice to suspend him in the    |
| air momentarily, Poison and Ignite can combine to tick away chunks of his   |
| health, and Blizzard has a chance to Freeze. If you need to heal, wait for  |
| an attack to dodge then strike or else you'll end up hit with a Lightning   |
| Bolt that could end up being your demise.                                   |
