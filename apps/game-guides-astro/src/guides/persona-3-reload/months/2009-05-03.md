**Daytime**

> From today onwards Tanaka's Amazing Commodities airs every Sunday during the day, you can access it from the tv in your room or from the tv in the lounge. The shopping channel has some great items, but I do recommend skipping some though as buying every single item can get pricy.
>
> If you want to collect every single item from the shopping channel, I've included recommended amounts of yen you'll need at the end of each Tartarus visit.
>
> If you want to see the full list of every item you can get, click [Tanaka's Amazing Commodities](tanakas-amazing-commodities).
