Theurgy tutorial

The group gets new outfits as well as new gear. Make sure to equip the new weapons on everyone, for some characters these weapons will be a significant upgrade over the old gear. Gearing on Fuuka isn’t needed, she’s going to be your navigator from now on, so she won't be directly involved in any combat.

> The only gear that has any effect on Fuuka is gear that increases SP, if you get any you can equip her with them. The game has an ability where if an enemy's weakness is known you can hit RB/R1 and you will instantly swap to a persona that has that skill.
