**After School**

> Elizabeth will tell you humans have begun wandering into Tartarus and must be rescued by a set date. You can see more details on the bulletin board outside the police station, which includes the name, the date they need to be rescued by and a small description. You won’t be rescuing them today as more humans will wander in later on in the month, you'll be rescuing them all at the same time, just before the full moon.

Dismiss Inugami, then enter the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:
