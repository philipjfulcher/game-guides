> You'll get access to Mayoido Antiques tonight, it's by far the best shop in the game. You can do all your gear crafting here, and exchange gems for skill cards, items and incenses. It's where you'll be getting nearly all your gear from now on.

Enter the antiques shop, then exit the shop and go see Elizabeth.

Hand in quest 40 to Elizabeth, which unlocks:

- 41\. Bring me the mysterious person's autograph

You should be able to hand this in straight away.

Return to the antiques shop, there isn't a lot you can do here atm, but if you've been keeping up with Elizabeth's quests you should have a Black Sword, Nihil Cloth and a Nihil Blade. I'd trade these for a Nameless Katana, Plate Mail and Source Yumi. Equip the first two on Makoto, and the bow on Yukari.

> The Devil arcana is one that you don't need a matching persona in order to get a rank up each time.
