**Late Night**

After the intro, you'll find yourself in Iwatodai Station. There isn't much you can do atm, so once you’ve finished looking around head south to the next area, and then head left at the mall to enter another cutscene.

You'll be given an option to choose your name, the cannon name is “Makoto Yuki”. It’s the name I’ll be using for this guide, but feel free to use whatever name you want, it has no impact on the story.

Once you've been escorted to your room by Yukari, put away your items in the closet and go to sleep.

> If you have any DLC purchased, access the closet a second time to have the items added to your game.
