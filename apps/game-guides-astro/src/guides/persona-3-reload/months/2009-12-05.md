**Evening**

Head to the Antiques store and upgrade your gear, if you don't have one yet, grab a Regenerate 3 card, you'll need it for a quest.

> **Important! Important!**
> Some of the gear I have listed here requires Gold Quartz, which you can't get until the next Tartarus block; I've included it here as it's mixed in with the Silver Quart gear. Even though you can't get every gear listed here, this will give you the opportunity to see what materials you need for each piece and how much you'll need of each material.

| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Makoto**   | Kaneshige       | Fairy Cloak      | Mysterious Geta or Silent Sandals | Power Transmitter or Power Enhancer |
| **Yukari**   | Circe's Bow     | Golden Dress     | Mysterious Geta or Silent Sandals | Yellow Shawl or Vayu Bracers        |
| **Junpei**   | Qingdi Blade    | Fairy Cloak      | Dragon Boots                      | Green Shawl or Agni Bracers         |
| **Akihiko**  | Double Ziggurat | Fairy Cloak      | Mysterious Geta or Silent Sandals | Blue Shaw or Indra Bracers          |
| **Mitsuru**  | Brionac         | Water God Armour | Mysterious Geta or Silent Sandals | Red Shawl or Varna Bracers          |
| **Aigis**    | Kyriotes        | Fifth Number     | Free Walkers                      | Yellow Shawl or Vijaya Bracers      |
| **Koromaru** | Tyrant's Knife  | Star Dog Suit    | Bare Paws                         | Ratri Bracers                       |
| **Ken**      | Tonbo-kiri      | Fairy Cloak      | Mysterious Geta or Silent Sandals | Ushas Bracers                       |

> If you have Aigis in your party, her Kyriotes has Auto Masuku (Increased Accuracy/Evasion for the whole party) so I would use Mysterious Geta. If you're not using Aigis I would still go with Silent Sandals.
>
> A couple of personas do have Auto Masuku on them, but you'll be replacing it with Spell Master soon.
>
> If you're following the fusion and gearing guide, you should have Auto Mataru (Attack up for the whole party) on the power transmitter equipped on Makoto, Auto Maraku (Defence up for the whole party) as a skill on all your personas. Auto Masuku (Accuracy/Evasion up for the whole party on Aigis weapon, or Silent Sandals on all your party members.
>
> It's worth making a few copies of Life Aid (5x should be plenty)
>
> You can replace the Auto Tarukaja on Siegfried with either Life Aid or Resist Dark if you farmed one earlier. You can replace any persona that has Auto Tarukaja with another skill now, I'd recommend either a Resist or a Boost skill card if you have them. Highly optional.
