> You might be able to hand in quest 61 straight away, if you're following the non DLC fusion path. If you're following the DLC fusion path, then you will be one level short at this stage. Don't worry if your personas are slightly short, you'll naturally reach it during the next Tartarus visit.

Head to Station Outskirts and enter Mahjong Parlor Red Hawk (Requires Courage Rank 5)

Head to the Labatory on the 1F at school and enter.

Spend time with Chihiro

**Evening**

Speak to Shinjiro, then return to Elizabeth and hand in quests 66, 67, and 68. Which unlocks:

- 69\. Bring me oil

Speak to Aigis, then return to Elizabeth and hand in quest 69.

> If you were able to hand in quest 61 earlier, Elizabeth will ask you to escort her to Gekkoukan. I'd hold off on doing it for now, as not everyone will have access to this hangout yet.

Equip Rocket Punch on Aigis and Scrub Brush on Ken.

Tend to the garden with Shinjiro.
