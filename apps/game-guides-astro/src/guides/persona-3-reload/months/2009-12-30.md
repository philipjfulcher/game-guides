> **Important! Important!**
> As soon as you are level 69, fuse Loki. You'll need to get him to level 76 for Spell Master before you do any more fusions. Use Growth 3 on him until he reaches level 76, then replace Growth 3 with Spell Master.

> Once you get an Arcana Burst today, you'll unlock the J rank skill cards. These give significantly more yen than previous tiers, so even though you need a lot of yen today, you can farm it much faster as well.

Try to get the Lovers, Devil and Justice/Star Arcana cards tonight.

Head to 197F and continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 203F for the first gatekeeper of the block. Defeat it and open the chests, then give the Adamant Armour to whoever you think needs it.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 212F for the next gatekeeper. Defeat it and open the chests, then give Junpei the Dojigiri Yasutsuna.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 218F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it and open the chests. I wouldn't equip Mitsuru with Longinus, the Auto Tarukaja is useless if you have Power Transmitter on Makoto.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 225F for the last gatekeeper of the black, defeat it and open the chests. Give the Carbon Jacket to whoever you think needs it.

The Monad passage is also on the 225F, defeat the first shadow and open the chests. Defeat the second shadow and open the chest for the Sun and Judgement Major Arcana cards.

Head up to the 226F for the border floor, open the chest and return to the entrance.
