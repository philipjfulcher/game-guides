**Early Morning**

You’ll find yourself at school and you'll be told you need to find the faculty office. You’ll notice lots of npc’s that you can talk to, talk to them if you want, and when you’re ready follow the ! point on your mini map.

> Npc dialogue updates frequently in this game, anytime you see a blue dialogue bubble it means it's been updated. I’d highly recommend keeping up with the SEES party members dialogue, especially the dorm dialogue, it adds a lot of context and character development that you would otherwise miss.

**After School**

You’re given the option to explore the school, once you’ve finished looking around, head out the front door. Make your way through the station and the mall to return to the dorm.

**Evening**

The game will ease you into its various activities during the opening weeks, as a result there isn't a lot to do atm, head to your room and sleep.
