Story Event

**Evening**

You'll find various social links scattered around all three floors; you can also go into the rooms to talk to people.

> This is your only opportunity to buy the items from 6HARA and the Vending Machine in Kyoto.

Grab a souvenir from the 6HARA Clerk, and the drinks from the Vending Machine on the 2F.

Once you've finished talking to people, head for your room.
