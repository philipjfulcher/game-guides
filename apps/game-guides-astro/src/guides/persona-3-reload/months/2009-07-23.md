> You unlock the ability to always ambush shadows as long as you're sprinting, even if the shadows notices you, and it works on all shadows. It does take a bit of a run up to activate, you will see blue streaks behind you and Makoto will leap up into the air when you attack. When you next go to Tartarus, test it out when there are no shadows around to get a feel for it, it will make moving around Tartarus much easier and quicker.
