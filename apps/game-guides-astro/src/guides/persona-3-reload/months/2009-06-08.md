Story Event

**Evening**

You'll be sneaking around the school tonight, follow the ! Point on map to advance.

**Dark Hour**

(Side note: Mitsuru is completely fine with Junpei possibly using explosives to get into the school, but threatens to execute them for wanting to sneak a look at some test papers)

> You might get a Major Arcana card appearing in a shuffle time. I would ignore them for tonight, you aren’t going to be in Tartarus long enough to make use of them.
>
> It seems like every shadow is a guaranteed shuffle time and that it always has a yen card in it. I’d recommend grabbing every single one, it’s a very quick 15k yen.
>
> Fully explore all the floors, there's a lot of chests with some useful items, and it will make sure you will fight the all the shadows for the guaranteed yen cards.
>
> Try to make sure Naga is your equipped persona when you kill the boss tonight. It gives a ton of exp, and you'll want to get Naga up to level 22 so it can learn Invigorate 1, it's a very useful skill that restores 3 SP every turn.

Fight your way through the shadows and meet up with your teammates a couple of floors up. After the cutscene you'll be thrown into your second Major Arcana boss battle.
