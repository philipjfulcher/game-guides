> You’ll sometimes receive invites from your school friends on your days off. You can’t rank up while doing these, but they do give social link points, so you'll be needing matching personas for these. They are unique events that sometimes give extra context to a specific social link rank, so they are worth doing. Don’t accept the invite straight away though, you'll often need to do other things first before accepting.
>
> Sometimes you'll get more than one invite, if you want to see the other invites that I don't say to do, then you can make use of the Rewind feature. Once you've watched a scene, you then use rewind, this can be repeated as many times as you need in order to see all the invites on a specific day. You then do whatever activity is in the guide.
