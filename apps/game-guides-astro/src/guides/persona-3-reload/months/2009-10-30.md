Before starting today, fuse Hecatoncheires, and level him to level 53 for Auto Maraku, before doing any other fusions.

| White Rider and Cu Chulainn Result: Hecatoncheires | Charge, Auto Tarukaja, Life Aid and Growth 2 | Vile Assault, Heatwave, Regenerate 2 and Endure |

- Replace Growth 2, with Growth 3 if you have it. Replace Growth 2/3 with Auto Maraku when it reaches level 53

As usual I'd recommend getting the Lovers, Justice and Devil cards if you can.

Return to 143F and continue until you reach the 151F for first gatekeeper of the block. Defeat it and open the chests, then give the Hero's Cape to Ken.

Continue climbing until you reach the 155F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it, then open the chests and give Aristocracy to Mitsuru.

Continue climbing until you reach the 161F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it, then open the chests and give the Tetra Jammer armour to whoever you think needs it the most.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 170F for your next back-to-back gatekeeper fights, defeat both of them and open the chests. I wouldn't give Akihiko Rapid Bands, the Endure on the Champion Gloves is better than the slightly higher attack stat.

Skip the Monad passage for the moment, you're about to make one of the best personas in the game, which will make the passage much easier to do. Head up to the 172F for the border floor and open the chest.

Return to the entrance and hand in quest 70 to Elizabeth.

> You can return to the first part of Tziah and grab the Monad doors here if you want extra base materials and gemstones for gear crafting. It drops all the same ones as the second part of Tziah.

> If you're using DLC Personas, then click [DLC Fusion Guide October 30th.](dlc-fusion-guide-main-game#october-30th)

You'll want to farm until you have 500k, are at least level 56 and Hectoncheires has learnt Auto Maraku. Lovers Arcana is recommended but not essential.

When you're ready, save your game, enter the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

> Most of the personas will now have Auto Maraku which increases defence for the entire party for the first 3 turns, and Enduring Soul. Enduring Soul is like Endure but will also fully restore your hp when activated.

You just unlocked two new Theurgies:

- Best Friends, which gives Concentrate and Charge  
   (From having Decarabia and Forneus)
- Scarlot Havoc  
   (From having Siegfried and Mithras)

Dismiss Succubus, Rangda and Decarabia

The persona's that you want to have on you are **Parvati, Titania, Throne, Atropos, Siegfried, Suzaku, Chernobog,** **Cu Chulainn, Nidhoggr** and **Ganesha**

Hand in quest 71 to Elizabeth

- Teach Growth 2/3 to Chernobog, replace Poision Mist
- Teach Growth 2/3 to Atropos, replace Dekunda
- Teach Growth 2/3 to Suzaku replace Diarahan, replace Growth with Fire amp at level 61

> Nidhoggr will be your buff and de-buff persona for the rest of the game. It has nearly every buff and debuff on it, you're just missing Marakukaja and Masukunda. They are both rank 9 skill cards, but are optional, only farm them if you want to complete the set. If you want a perfect buff and de-buff persona you can also teach him Dekaja and Dekunda.

> Mahamaon with Hama Boost on shadows that are weak to light, has a very good to chance to one shot them. If it misses any in a group, you can use Kougan on any stragglers.

> Siegfried is one of the best physical personas in the game, which is why he is more specialized for crit rate and damage. Make sure to use his Charge ability before you use the new Scarlet Havoc Theurgy and have Siegfried as the active persona when using Scarlet Havoc.
>
> I'd replace Brave Blade with either Slash Boost or Multi-Target Boost. Slash boost gives 25% damage bonus but needs to be farmed, whereas Multi-Target Boost is a 15% damage bonus, but you get it from Elizabeth. Both works well so go with whatever you have.
>
> If you farmed an Apt pupil earlier, I'd replace Auto Rebellion for it. Both give extra crit, the only difference is Apt Pupil is an unconditional crit boost, whereas Auto Rebellion requires Siegfried to be the starting persona. Again, both work well so go with whatever you have.
>
> I'd replace Life Aid with Growth 2/3, then replace Growth with Slash Amp when it hits level 61.
>
> The reason for these changes is because the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy with Slash Amp, Slash Boost/Multi-Target Boost and Charge can nearly one-shot any enemy in the game, even gatekeepers and Monad Bosses on Merciless. All those skills work on Deathbound too, so even though we actually deleted a stronger skill in Brave Blade, the extra damage from Slash Boost/Multi-Target Boost on both Deathbound and Scarlet Havoc easily make up for it.

Return to the 171F and enter the Nomad Passage, defeat the first shadow and give the Whirlwind Bow to Yukari. Defeat the second and third shadows, then open the chests to get the Star Major Arcana.

You'll want to have at least **275k** yen after selling all your loot.

> **Important! Important!**
> Make sure you have personas from the following arcana's **Strength, Star, Temperence, Lovers, Moon, Justice, Fortune, Priestess,** and **Tower,** these are going to be the social links that you'll be working on. You will want to have at least **275k** after selling your loot
>
> If you want to buy all shopping channel items, you will need at least 370k.
>
> If you want to work out what your loot is worth before you leave, then you can use [Loot and Breakable Objects Tziah Block 2](loot-and-breakable-objects#tziah-block-2-145f-172fbreakable-objects), which has the name and sale values of everything.

> You're about to do your first rank up where you must choose whether you want to stay friends or commit to a relationship. If you want to have the option to see the Christmas Eve date scene for that character, then you must be in a relationship with them.

Spend time with Chihiro

- Don't worry, she'll help us (+1)
- You need to tell her yourself (+1)
- Any
- What's gotten into you? (+1)
- (Justice Rank 9)
- **Platonic:** I like working with you, but...
- Any
- **Relationship:** I feel the same, Chihiro.
- Any

If you choose to get into a relationship here, you will unlock:

- Achievement/Trophy: That Special Someone (38/48)

> You don’t have to get into a relationship with Chihiro for this achievement, but you will need to enter a relationship with someone before the end of the game. If you want the achievement now but don’t want to be in a relationship with Chihiro, choose the relationship route, then use the rewind feature to go back to after school.
