title: GRIND 4
order: 15
---

The Tower of the Moon is the next area you need to go to, but it is difficult
for your current levels. I recommend you do a grinding session here. If you
choose to grind near Dirkandor, you can fight Metal Slimes. Or you can Zoom to
Slewse and fight some tougher monsters around town or the first floor of the
Tower of the Moon south of town. My recommendation is that you do the latter, as
you need gold.

Earn 16000G. Zoom to Burrowell and buy an Aurora Blade for the Hero. If you
choose to use it as an item in battle, it will cast Dazzle on a group of
monsters. Up until now, in my playthrough, my Hero had been using the Steel
Broadsword I got WAY back in Moonahan.

Now earn 21500G and Zoom to Slewse or Burrowell to buy a Power Shield for the
Prince. Equip it and sell his Leather Shield. If you use the Power Shield in
battle, it will cast Midheal on the party member that has it, giving you a free
heal. Eventually you may want to get Power Shields for everybody.

I recommend getting the Hero to level 28, the Prince to level 26 and the
Princess to level 21. At level 25 the Prince learns Kabuff which raises the
party's physical defense. At level 21 the Princess learns Kaboom, which hits all
monsters on the screen regardless of grouping for a nice amount of damage at a
cost of 8 MP.

If you can afford it, get a second Power Shield and give it to the Hero but do
not equip it, as Erdrick's Shield has more defense. Instead, use it in battle to
restore your HP. If you cannot afford it yet, do not worry about it.

You should be good enough to do the next area of the game, the Tower of the
Moon. From Slewse, head south and use the Ship to cross the river to the Tower.
