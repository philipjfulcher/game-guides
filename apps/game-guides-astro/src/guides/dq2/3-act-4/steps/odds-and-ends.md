Zoom to Cannock and enter. Open the gold-rimmed door with your Gold Key and open
the Treasure Chest to receive ERDRICK'S SHIELD. Only the Hero can equip it, so
go ahead and do that. Sell the Steel Shield.

Zoom to Moonahan and enter. Find a small building with a gold-rimmed door just
southwest of the House of Worship. Use your Gold Key on the door and go
downstairs.

Down here, Quick Save, then use your Jailor's Key on the door and walk north for
a battle with 2 Grimlins. They can cast Midheal, Fizzle, Sizzle and Call other
Grimlins. Just use your physical attacks and they will go down.

Once you have defeated the Grimlins, a sparkle will appear in the northeast
corner. Search it to get the WATER SIGIL. Two down, three to go.

Zoom to Tantegel and enter. Head west to the Equipment Shop and head upstairs.
Use your Gold Key on the door and talk to the King. He will give you the SOUL
SIGIL. Three down, two to go.

Make sure you have on you the Mark of Erdrick. Sail south of Tantegel, then
follow the water southeast and south. You should see a Shrine to the east. This
is the Holy Sanctum from the original game. Enter.

Talk to the guy while holding the Mark of Erdrick and he will recognize your
party as Erdrick's descendants. He will step to the side, allowing you to grab
ERDRICK'S HELM. Only the Hero can equip it, so go ahead and do that.

Zoom to Zahan. Make sure everybody is fully healed. Step into the damage tiles
while keeping an eye on your HP. You want to head to the Jail door to the west.
Open the door with your Jailor's Key and open the Treasure Chest to receive the
SUBTLE SHUTTLE. Now you have the two items that Don Calico needs. However we
still need to find his hometown, Slewse.

Rest up at the Inn. Now go into the Damage Tiles again, this time going to the
eastern room. Open the Jail door to access a Chest that contains a PRAYER RING.

Zoom to Burrowell and get into your Ship. Follow the coast northwest past the
impassable mountains. Once you are past that, ignore the first river you see.
Take the next river (the one close to a bridge) north to the northwest tip.

Around this area you will encounter some new monsters that may be a little
difficult for your levels and current equipment. Headhunters have decent attack.
Magic Marionettes can lower your MP. Brainy Badboons can cast Dazzle and Kasap.
Miasmas can cast Snooze and Dazzle.

Head west and north past the small Poisonous Swamp. Head east through the hills
and you should soon see a town. Go around the mountains and enter the town.
