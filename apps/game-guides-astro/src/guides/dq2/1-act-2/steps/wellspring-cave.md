The Wellspring Cave has the same monsters you met before along with a new
monster called a Cobra King. Be careful as they have a chance of poisoning you.

Head north and east to some water. Get the Chest south of you which contains a
MEDICINAL HERB. Now take the eastern path south, then west to find a chest with
~84G. Head back to the water. The eastern path in the darkness leads to some
stairs. Downstairs is a guy who talks about the Wellspring, but there's no
treasure here, so skip it if you want. Take the northern path and follow it
east, west and southwest to a Treasure Chest containing an ANTIDOTAL HERB.

Head north to the Wellspring of the Hero. Talk to the guy and he will heal your
HP up to full for you. Answer "Yes" to his question to learn that the Prince is
in Midenhall looking for you.

Note : If he does not mention the Prince, it means you did not talk to the King
of Cannock, which means you will have to backtrack to see him.

Head back to the water, then head west and south to the exit.
