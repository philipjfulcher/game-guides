title: GRIND 1
order: 2
---

Ok, it is time to do a short grind. I recommend doing it in the hills just north
of Midenhall. Make sure you stay on the southern few rows of hills because
further north are tougher monsters. There are only two monsters here, Slimes and
Mauluscs, both of which are quite weak. If you run into anything else, you are
too far north.

The goal is to get to level 3 and buy the Leather Shield for 90G. I recommend
also grabbing a Medicinal Herb and an Antidotal Herb. Medicinal Herbs heal some
HP and Antidotal Herbs cure Poison.

A person in Midenhall mentioned a town to the west called Leftwyne. Rest at the
Inn, then start travelling west. Once you pass some sand you will run into a few
more monsters. Because you got the Leather Shield, the Iron Ants and Drackies
should be no match for you.

Either go north around the impassible mountains or go through the northern part
of the Poisonous Swamp. You should be able to see a town now. Enter the town.
