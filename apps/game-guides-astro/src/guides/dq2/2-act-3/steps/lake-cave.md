Welcome to the Lake Cave! The main item you are looking for here is not required
to beat the game but it will definitely help. You will need it if you want to
talk to everybody or play Tombola in some towns. Without this item, it will be
more difficult to locate an item which helps you find other items. Also, it will
be more difficult to get an excellent piece of armour and the best weapon for
the Princess later in the game. I highly recommend you do this part. Plus, it is
relatively short walk.

**Floor B1**

On this floor are Fat Rats, Healslimes, Cobra Kings and a new monster, Somnol
Ants. Somnol Ants have the spell Snooze which has a 50% chance of putting a
party member to sleep. A single cast hits all party members.

Go south and open the Treasure Chest to get a SEED OF AGILITY. I suggest saving
it for the Princess. Head west and south past the water. Enter the darkened area
to find a Treasure Chest containing a TOMBOLA TICKET. Exit this room and head
west and south to the stairs.

**Floor B2**

Head west and south. Enter the dark room to the east to a Chest with a SEED OF
LIFE. I suggest either wait for the Princess or use it on the Prince. Continue
south and get the ANTIDOTAL HERB in the western room. Go south to the fork and
take the western path, leading to a room that has a CHIMAERA WING and ~194G. Now
go back to the fork and take the path east and south. At the end of this path
you will find the SILVER KEY, which opens up all doors lined with silver.

Now that you have found the main item of the dungeon, we can exit. Head north as
far as you can, then head east to the stairs.

**Floor B1**

Follow the path north and east to the water. Head eastward north of the water,
then head north to the stairs. If you still have Herbs or MP left and you do not
have at least 564G yet, grind next to the stairs or outside in the hills south
of the Lake Cave until you have the gold.
