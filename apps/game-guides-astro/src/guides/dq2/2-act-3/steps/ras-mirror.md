title: RA'S MIRROR
order: 3
---

From Moonahan, step on the bridge. From the bridge, take 3 steps east, 3 steps
south and head west to get out of Badboon territory. These monsters are pretty
tough right now. Keep heading west through the forest. Do not go south until you
hit sand because there are more Badboons and Dragonfries there.

Once you hit the sand, go south and you should see a Castle surrounded by a
Poisonous Swamp. This is Moonbrooke Castle, the Castle that was sacked when the
game began. You could check this place out now, but I do not suggest it.

Instead, head back east, but this time stay south of the water. You should see a
couple bridges followed by a sparkle on a Poisonous Swamp. Search the sparkle
for RA'S MIRROR. Use your Chimaera Wing and return to Moonahan.

Find the dog in this town and approach it. Press Y to bring up the Menu and use
Ra's Mirror. The Mirror will be destroyed and the curse on the dog will be
lifted.

The dog transforms into the Princess of Moonbrooke. So THAT is what happened to
her. She will join you, which will complete your party line-up. She starts at
level 1 with the Midheal spell. Be sure to buy her a Divine Dagger. If you saved
the Seed of Agility and the Seed of Life for her, use them on her now.

Note : Inn prices will now be 3 times what it was when the Hero was alone, and
1.5 times what it was before the Princess joined.
