title: RENDARAK
order: 7
---

Welcome to the snowy plateau of Rendarak! Some of the monsters here have instant
death spells that can hit your entire party, so be sure to Heal and Quick Save
after each battle.

Here we have some new monsters. Cyclops can do a grievous hit. Frostburns can
cast Kasap, Kabuff and Thwack. The chance of Thwack killing a party member is
low but there nonetheless. Also, there are Silvapithecus that can put your party
to sleep with its Sickly-Sweet Breath and can also cast Sizzle.

From the cave exit, head east, then northeast through the snow. After a bit of a
walk you should be able to spot a Shrine next to four bridges. Enter the Shrine.
Congratulations! You have just made it through the most difficult part in the
game! Well, apart from the final boss, that is.

Now you should have all Zoom points in the game.

Talk to the Priest to get your HP and MP filled. You can use the Teleportal to
get back to Beran if you wish but it is more convenient to use Zoom.

North and west of the Shrine you can run into some new monsters. The Gigantes
can do a grievous hit on you. They can drop Swords of Ruin which sell for 11250G
a pop. Archdemons can hit your party with a fiery Torrent of Flames or they can
Kaboom your party. Back to back Kabooms can be dangerous. They can drop Prayer
Rings.

Oh boy. The Batmandrills. They were called Gold Batboons in the NES version and
were a source of frustration to many Dragon Warrior II players. They have Poison
Breath, Fire Breath and they can attack twice. They can cast Sizzle. But they
also have another spell: Kamikazee. There is a chance that they can use
Kamikazee if they are low on HP. Called Sacrifice in the NES game, this spell is
guaranteed to kill everybody in your party. Half your gold gone instantly. I
remind you that there is no Vault in the NES game. I hope you saved, because if
you did not, you are going to have to do all that grinding AGAIN. Fortunately,
this version has Quick Save, so be sure to make full use of it. Also,
Batmandrills have a chance of dropping Wailer's Mail which you can sell for
4800G a pop.
