title: GALEN'S GRAVE
order: 1
---

You need 2 keys at least for the next dungeon. Once you are all set, head
northwest to Galenholm. When you get to the settlement, use a key on the door to
the big building. In this building are three chests containing a COPPER SWORD, a
TORCH and ~630G. If you use a Magic Key and talk to the old lady in the purple
dress, she will give you another Magic Key. Position yourself directly north of
the old lady. Go west one square, then go north into the blackness. Follow the
pathway and talk to the guy to gain access to the stairs. You have just entered
Galen's Grave.

**Floor B1**

Go east to the wall, then go north. Take the first path going east all the way
to the wall. Next, head north and west to three chests. Open them for a SEED OF
LIFE, 535G and a MAGIC KEY. Head back east and this time go all the way south.
Use a Magic Key on the door, then follow the path to the stairs.

**Floor B2**

You will find yourself in the northeast corner of this floor. You can choose to
go west or south; either way, make it to the stairs on the southwest corner. Be
sure to keep your HP above 50 for the next floors.

**Floor B3**

On this floor there are some new monsters. Spitegeists can cast Sizz, Snooze and
Fizzle. Drohl Diabolists can cast Snooze. Raving Lunaticks can cast Heal and
Sizz. And the hardest monster in this dungeon, the Skeleton Soldier, can cast
Heal and also does pretty good physical damage. Anyway, head north, taking the
path to the right to find the stairs.

**Floor B4**

Make your way to the east side of the room and climb the stairs in the centre.

**Floor B3**

In this room, open the chest to receive the LYRE OF IRE. This item is not one of
Erdrick's artefacts, but it can be traded for one. You are done in this dungeon
so cast Evac to get back to the overworld.
