Welcome to Leftwyne! Go to the Equipment Shop to the northwest and go up the
stairs. Position yourself south of the lady and talk to her. Wait for her to
move, then search the drawer for a TOMBOLA TICKET. Unfortunately, the Tombola
game in Leftwyne is behind a locked door, and you don't have any keys yet. I
recommend putting it in the Vault for later. Talk to the lady in the Item Shop
to gain access to the Vault.

An old guy in town says he cannot make the journey north to Cannock. We were
told earlier by the King of Midenhall to seek the Prince of Cannock out. So
let's go there. Cannock Castle is straight north. You can't miss it.
