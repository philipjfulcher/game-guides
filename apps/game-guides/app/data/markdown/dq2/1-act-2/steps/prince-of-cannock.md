title: PRINCE OF CANNOCK
order: 3
---

From Wellspring Cave, head southwest, ignoring the bridge. When you see a
Poisonous Swamp to your east, go to the southern part. Keep an eye on your HP as
you go through the swamp. Head south through the hills and you should be able to
see Midenhall.

Have a talk with your father the King to learn that the Prince, having not found
you here, is on his way back to Cannock. Leave Midenhall and head west like you
are going back to Cannock. But make a pit stop at Leftwyne first.

Talk to the guy at the Inn. It's the Prince of Cannock! He will join your party
at level 1, but he has a Heal spell which will really come in handy and costs 2
MP. I suggest you get a Leather Shield for the Prince. Also get the Chain Sickle
for the Prince when you can afford it. Bring 2-3 Antidotal Herbs with you before
you leave.

Note : Inn prices will be double what they were before.
