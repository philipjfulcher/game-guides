title: GRIND 2
order: 4
---



Since the Prince starts at level 1, we need to grind for a bit. Stay around
Cannock until the Prince reaches level 3 and has the Chain Sickle. At level 3
the Prince learns Sizz, which deals some damage to all enemies in a group at a
cost of 2 MP.

Once the Prince is level 3 my suggestion is to grind west of Cannock near the
cave. Go west of Cannock and cross the bridge. Continue west through the narrow
forested passage between the mountains and you should see a cave. Grind in the
hills until the Hero is at least level 7 and the Prince is at least level 6. Use
Cannock if you need to rest, restock or save.

In the territory near the cave are Cobra Kings who have a chance to poison your
Party with every hit. Army Ants can call other Army Ants in battle. Healslimes
can Heal, as their name suggests. Magus can cast Sizz which will deal damage to
all party members. Fat Rats have no special ability.

At level 6 the Prince learns Squelch, which removes the Poison status from your
party member at a cost of 3 MP.

Go back to Cannock and get a Chain Sickle for the Hero and sell his Copper
Sword. Make sure you have 2-3 Antidotal Herbs, a couple Medicinal Herbs and a
Chimaera Wing for the upcoming cave, just in case the Prince runs out of MP.

The next part is optional but I strongly recommend it. Head for the cave west of
Cannock.
