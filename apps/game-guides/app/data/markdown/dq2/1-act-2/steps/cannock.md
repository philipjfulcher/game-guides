Welcome to Cannock! The guy south of the room with the Treasure Chest serves as
Cannock's Equipment Shop, but you probably can't afford anything yet.

Talk to the King to find out the Prince of Cannock is at the Wellspring of the
Hero. This is your next destination.

Note : If you do not talk to the King, you will not be able to trigger the next
       event, so be sure that you do.

Rest at the Inn and make sure you have 2 Medicinal Herbs and 2 Antidotal Herbs
in your inventory before you leave. You may not need them, but they are there
for insurance. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.

Start walking east, making sure you stay north of the impassable mountains.
Cross some sand and a bridge. Eventually you should be able to see Wellspring
Cave. Do not go east of the cave because you may run into a Magus which are too
tough for you right now. Enter the cave.
