Note : You need a Yggdrasil Leaf for the next part. To get one, Zoom to
       Burrowell, sail east to Yggdrasil Island and search the trees in the
       middle. Be aware that you can only hold 1 at a time.

If you have been following this walkthrough, there should be one town that you
have yet to explore. You can choose to get there by land or by sea. Both routes
take roughly the same time.



Land Route


Zoom to Cannock and start walking west to Gwaelin's Gate. Use your Gold Key on
the door here and take the Teleportal to another Shrine, which I will call the
Beran Shrine. Ignore the other two Teleportals and leave this Shrine.

Start heading southeast. When you get to the water, continue east through the
hills. Cross the bridge, then cross another bridge to the south. From the
bridge, head southwest until you find the town. Enter the town.




Sea Route


Zoom to Zahan and start sailing east. Keep an eye on your map. After a while,
you should appear at the southwestern corner of the map. The town you are
looking for is the flashing orange square northeast of you. Head there. Dock on
the coast and enter the town.

Welcome to Beran! If you have not already done so, buy the second Power Shield
and give it to the Hero (but keep Erdrick's Shield equipped). Store the Tectonic
Plate and the Moonshard in the Vault.

Make sure you have your Yggdrasil Leaf, then rest at the Inn.

When you wake up, the Prince will be sick. He will tell you to leave him behind
and continue on to Hargon. Screw that. Stand 1 step north of the Prince in the
bed, face south, then press Y to access the Menu. Use the Yggdrasil Leaf and
select the Prince to administer the cure. He will rejoin your party. This is the
only Inn rest in the game where you have to do this. Leave town.

Zoom to Burrowell and sail east to Yggdrasil Island to grab another Yggdrasil
Leaf.
