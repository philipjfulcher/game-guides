title: HARGON'S CASTLE 1
order: 8
---

You are not ready for the final boss yet, but there are a couple of items you
can pick up in Hargon's Castle on the first floor. Both items are cursed, but
you can sell them for gold. Make sure you Quick Save often in case of multiple
Kabooms, Thwack or Kamikazee on the way. Also, bring the Eye of Rubiss with you.

From Rendarak Shrine, head west across the bridges. Keep heading west until you
see a narrow forested path to the northwest. Enter this passage and follow it
south. Once you hit the water, you should be able to barely see a Castle to the
south. This is your final destination. Either head southwest through the forest
or southeast through the hills until you see a hilly path south of Hargon's
Castle. Head north through this path to the Castle.

Welcome to... Midenhall? What is going on? The King of Midenhall has joined with
Hargon in the name of justice? WHAT? Why is everybody praising this guy? He
KILLED the King of Moonbrooke and many of his guards! How could everybody forget
that? How convenient. Something is very wrong here.

Try using the Eye of Rubiss. Oh. Well, there you go. Welcome to the REAL
Hargon's Castle!

**Floor 1F**

There are no random encounters on this floor. However, if you talk to the flames
next to the Throne, you will fight 2 Batmandrills, each one in their own
grouping.

Stand directly west of the Throne. Go 1 step north, 1 step west, then cast Safe
Passage. Go north 1 step into a damage tile and a "!" should appear above your
head. Use your Gold Key or cast Click (if you have it) to open the door. Step
into the blackness. Head northwest harmlessly to a Chest which contains a
DEVIL'S TAIL.

From this Chest, go 1 step east into the blackness and cast Safe Passage again.
Now head to the northeast room to a Chest which contains a WAILER'S MAIL.

The middle room leads upstairs to the rest of the Castle. However, you are not
yet ready for that. Instead, get out of here. If you try to cast Evac, it will
not work. However, casting Zoom does. Zoom back to Rendarak Shrine. Find a town
and sell the cursed items you just collected.
