Make sure you are equipped as listed above. The next dungeon is the most
difficult in the game but you should be able to handle it now. Also, if you have
any Prayer Rings in your Vault, now is the time to bring them and, if necessary,
use them.

From the Inn in Beran, head northeast. Use your Jailor's Key on the door, cast
Safe Passage and walk north through the Teleportal. Head upstairs to talk to the
guy if you want. Go one square south of the Teleportal, then head south to exit
the place. The Gremlin to the northwest has nothing important to say.

Head west a bit and talk to the flame. If you do not have the Eye of Rubiss, the
flame will not let you through. But since you do, it will disappear, giving you
partial access to the Cave to Rendarak, but you have to do one more thing.

Head to the northern part of the Poisonous Swamp. Go 4 steps west into the
Swamp. Now face north. Use the False Idol in this spot and the Cave to Rendarak
will open up for you. Enter the cave.
