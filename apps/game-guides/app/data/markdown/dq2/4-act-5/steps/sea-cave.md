title: SEA CAVE
order: 1
---



If you can afford it, Zoom to Burrowell or Slewse and get the second Power
Shield for the Hero so he can heal in battle. In any case, Zoom to Dirkandor and
rest at the Inn.

Leave Dirkandor and press X to view your map. The Sea Cave is the next dungeon.
It's the purple flashing square just to your southwest. Sail there and head to
the southern side. Position yourself 3 squares south of the entrance. Use the
Moonshard in this spot. The shoals surrounding the cave will disappear. Enter
the cave.



**Floor B1**


Holy lava! Stepping on the lava will damage you by 1 HP per step. Use Safe
Passage so that the lava does not damage you.

Head west and north through the lava. Head east and pick up the ~1188G in the
Chest. Return to the dungeon entrance.

This time, head south and take the first path you see going west. Ignore the
darkened room and continue west and north to a Chest. It contains a SEED OF
MAGIC.

Head south and to the stairs.



**Floor B2**


The dark room to the south contains a Chest. IT'S A TRAP! Upon opening this
Chest, the Hero will be poisoned, so ignore this Chest.

Instead, start heading west of this room. Head south through the opening, then
head west where you should see a lava-filled path heading north. Head south from
this path and make your way to the darkened room to the southeast. Head north to
the Chest to receive a PRAYER RING.

Backtrack to the lava-filled path heading north and follow it to the stairs.



**Floor B3**


Use your Gold Key to open the door. As you head west, ignore the first Chest you
see (it's a trap) and open the next one. You get a SEED OF STRENGTH.

Head south into the darkness. Circle around the wall to get to the Chest. It
contains a MAGIC ARMOUR. I suggest you equip it on the Hero. Although it has 5
less defense than the Tectonic Plate, the Magic Armour lowers any magic damage
the Hero may take.

South of this Chest you should see some stairs in a corner. 4 squares east of
these stairs are the stairs you want to take.



**Floor B4**


Cast Safe Passage and head northwest through the lava to some stairs.



**Floor B5**


Head south and east. You should be able to see a monster. Heal up to max, then
talk to the monster for a battle. Actually, two of them. Oh, they are
Whackolytes. No problem. A quick Kaboom will take care of them. Continue north
and grab the FALSE IDOL.

If you do not have the 21500G yet for the second Power Shield (for the Hero), I
suggest grinding on this floor until you do. Also, I recommend you get the Hero
to level 30, the Prince to level 28 and the Princess to level 23.

Once you are done, you can Evac out of the Sea Cave.
