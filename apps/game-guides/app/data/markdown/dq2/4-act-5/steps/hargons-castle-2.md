title: HARGON'S CASTLE 2
order: 10
---

Use the Eye of Rubiss to dispel the illusion.

**Floor 1F**

Head north until you are 1 step north and 2 steps west of the Throne. As before,
cast Safe Passage, head north 1 step and either use your Gold Key or cast Click
to unlock the hidden door. This time, head to the middle room and use your Gold
Key or Click it open. Walk north to the centre of the cross. Use the False Idol
in this spot.

**Floor 2F**

You can run into Dancing Flames on this floor and the next floor above. They can
use fire attacks and call other Dancing Flames. Their HP is low so you should be
able to make quick work of them no problem.

Head up the stairs to the northeast.

**Floor 3F**

On this floor you can run into Wrecktors. You have met this monster before at
Midenhall when you picked up your Lightning Staff earlier in the game. If you
recall, he has Kasap, Kabuff and Kaboom. But because he has help this time, he
can make use of his Kazing spell which revives a random monster to full HP and
is guaranteed to succeed. Kill these monsters first if you see them.

Follow the winding path to the stairs.

**Floor 4F**

On this floor and the floors above, there are no more random encounters. Make
your way to the stairs but stop a few steps before you reach the square next to
them. Heal up to max and Quick Save. Now take a few steps east for a battle.

| This guy is easy. Use Kabuff and Kasap on the first turn. On the second turn,|
| attack with the Hero and Prince. You can cast another Kasap, Defend or use a |
| Power Shield with the Princess to heal up. On the third turn, attack with the|
| Hero and Prince once again, and Fullheal with the Princess on anyone who     |
| needs it. If he is still not dead, wail on him until he is. Casting Hocus    |
| Pocus has a chance of an instant kill.                                       |

|                           and Kaboom. At low HP, he can also cast Kamikazee. |

| This guy is easy if you are lucky enough to avoid Kamikazee. Attack with the |
| Hero and the Prince and use Kasap with the Princess on the first turn. On the|
| second turn, he should go down unless he uses Fullheal or Kamikazee. If not, |
| keep attacking until he does. If he uses Kamikazee, reset and reload your    |
| Quick Save.                                                                  |

| Hocus Pocus has a 25% chance of either making Pazuzu flee from battle or     |

| Unless you made him flee, for defeating Pazuzu you get 4400 EXP and some     |
| gold. Victory!                                                               |

| This guy is not hard, but can be annoying if he keeps using Fullheal. Also,  |
| Kasap will not work on this guy. Attack with the Hero and Prince. You can use|
| Fullheal or Defend with the Princess if you want. However, if you try casting|
| Hocus Pocus, you can kill him instantly. Either way, keep at it and he should|
| go down soon enough.                                                         |

Heal to max and Quick Save. Make sure the Hero is holding the Yggdrasil Leaf.
Talk to Hargon. It does not matter if you answer "Yes" or "No" to his question.
Either way, prepare for the final battle!

Hurrah! Hargon is dead! With his dying breath, Hargon mumbles something about
Malroth. Who is Malroth? It is probably not important. Cast Evac and... oh, Evac
is not working. Okay, cast Zoom and... ow, your aching heads. I guess you will
have to walk out of here.

Go south and... what the...? Okay, try going west, and... wait! What's going on
here? Heal to max, use any Prayer Rings you have and Quick Save. Try going east
now and... IT'S A TRAP!

| MALROTH - 1750 HP - 240+ MP - Can cast Kasap and Kabuff. He can also use     |
|                               Blistering Flames and has a chance of attacking|
|                               twice.                                         |

| Malroth cannot be killed by Hocus Pocus. Fortunately, he is unable to heal   |
| himself. Attack with the Hero and cast Kabuff and Kasap on the first turn.   |
| In the subsequent turns, Kabuff when he uses Kasap and Kasap when he uses    |
| Kabuff. His Blistering Flames can pack a wallop, especially to the party     |
| member with the Flowing Dress. Heal anybody who goes below 120 HP. Kazing    |
| anyone who dies.                                                             |

| I do not recommend going all out with Malroth. Although it will take a little|
| time, this battle is more easily won if you take a defensive approach. Stay  |
| healed and defend when necassary. Use the Power Shields after every flame    |
| attack. Make sure you are Kabuffed to max and Malroth is Kasapped to max.    |
|                                                                              |
| After perhaps a dozen turns, Malroth will go down. Victory! This means the   |
| game is over now, right? RIGHT?                                              |
