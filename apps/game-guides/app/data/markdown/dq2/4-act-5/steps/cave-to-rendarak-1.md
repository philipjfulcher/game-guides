order: 5
---



Quick Save. There are collapsible floors in this cave. If you fall to the next
floor by accident, reset and reload your Quick Save.



**Floor 1F**


Make your way to the stairs just to the east of you.



**Floor B1**


Grab the SEED OF STRENGTH to the southeast. Now head north to a different flight
of stairs.



**Floor 1F**


Go directly east to the wall, then south to ascend the stairs.



**Floor 2F**


Start heading east. Ignore the first two intersections. At the third
intersection, head north and climb the stairs.



**Floor 3F**


Start heading southeast and ignore the dark room to the west. The Chest you see
here contains a TOMBOLA TICKET. Continue east to the stairs.



**Floor 4F**


WARNING : Heal up to max and Quick Save here. Green Dragons roam Floor 5F. If
          you get jumped by 4 of them and they all use Fire Breath, you could be
          in BIG trouble. However, if you manage to defeat them, they give
          really good experience.

Head up the stairs and hold your breath.



**Floor 5F**


Open the Treasure Chest. The Chest contains ERDRICK'S ARMOUR. Equip it on the
Hero. Now backtrack to Floor 3F.



**Floor 3F**


Backtrack until you reach the stairs you originally took to get on this floor.
Head west to the dark room and continue walking until you reach the stairs.



**Floor 4F**


Heal to max and Quick Save in case of heavy Green Dragon fire. Head upstairs.



**Floor 5F**


Head east to a Treasure Chest. It contains the MAD CAP. Equip it on either the
Prince or the Princess. If you equip it on the Princess, the cost of Kaboom will
be reduced to 6MP, so that is something to think about. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



**Floor 3F**


Head east back towards where you ascended to this floor. This time, take the
northwest path and get the Treasure Chest, which contains ~1450G. Follow the
path north until you hit the northern wall. You should be at a fork in the road.
Start heading west. Follow this path to the end and go up the stairs.



**Floor 4F**


Another Green Dragon warning. Heal and Quick Save. Climb the stairs.



**Floor 5F**


Head south, then west to the Treasure Chests. Inside them are a THANATOS' SHIELD
and ~592G. Do not equip this shield as it is Cursed. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



**Floor 3F**


Head east until you are back at the fork in the path. This time, take the
eastern path and go up the stairs.



**Floor 4F**


You know the drill. Heal and Quick Save before you climb the stairs.



**Floor 5F**


Take 3 steps north and 1 step west to fall into a pit.



**Floor 4F**


Head to the corner in the southwest of this room. From the corner, head 1 step
east and 1 step north to fall into a pit.



**Floor 3F**


Collect the THUNDERBOLT BLADE. Give it to the Hero and equip it. You can use it
as an item to cast lightning on multiple monsters in a group. Hand your Aurora
Blade to the Prince so he can equip it.

Note : Hargonauts have a chance to drop a second Thunderbolt Blade. Although
       only the Hero can equip the weapon, it can be used as an item in battle
       by another party member.

This is an opportune time to Evac out and Zoom to Beran to rest up. If you are
running low on MP, the entrance to the Cave to Rendarak is a short walk away
from here. Head east to the dead end to fall into a pit, then head directly
north to fall into another pit. You should be back at the beginning of the cave.
