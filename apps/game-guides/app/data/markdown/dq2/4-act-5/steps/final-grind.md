title: FINAL GRIND
order: 9
---



This is the last grind you will have to do, and it will be your longest grinding
session in the game by far. I suggest grinding in the hills west of Rendarak
Shrine because the item drops from these monsters are well worth it.

I recommend you get the Hero to level 43, the Prince to level 42 and the
Princess to level 40. This means you are going to be here for a little while.
Hargon's Castle is easy but the final boss is not. Plus, you will need gold for
some new equipment that will be helpful against the final bosses.

Quick Save after every couple of battles. You WILL be wiped out every so often
during this grind. Feel free to abuse the hell out of Kaboom.

As soon as you can afford to, Zoom to Burrowell or Slewse, buy a third Power
Shield for 21500G and give it to the Princess. Now every party member can heal
themselves for free during battle.

If you manage to earn 65000G, Zoom to Burrowell and buy the Mink Mantle. You can
equip it on either the Prince or the Princess. If you choose to equip it on the
Princess, equip the Flowing Dress on the Prince.

If you manage to earn another 25000G, Zoom to Slewse and buy the Falcon Blade
and give it to the Hero. You get 2 attacks with this weapon. If both hits land,
it will deal more or less the same damage as your Thunderbolt Blade does with
one hit, depending on the monsters' resilience. However, if you defeat a monster
with the first attack, you will immediately attack another monster with the
second hit. Therefore, you have the potential to hit two monsters in one turn
with this weapon. Do not get rid of the Thunderbolt Blade, as it is still useful
against monsters with high resilience.

If you manage to earn yet another 25000G, you can buy a Falcon Blade for the
Prince if you want. However, his Aurora Blade already does a decent amount of
damage. I do not recommend doing any extra grinding for it. But if you have the
money anyway, you may as well grab it.

At the end of your grind, your party should look like the following below:

Now, walk back to Hargon's Castle, making sure you have the Eye of Rubiss and
the False Idol with you. If you decided to go all the way to level 50, Holy
Protection will work here.
