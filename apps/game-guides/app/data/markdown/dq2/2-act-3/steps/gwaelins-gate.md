title: GWAELIN'S GATE
order: 1

Use a Chimaera Wing to get back to Cannock quickly. Sell both Leather Armours
for 113G apiece, earning you 226G. You should now have 790G, which is enough to
get 2 Chain Mails for your Hero and your Prince as well as a stay at the Inn.

With your new Key, you can access a drawer in northwestern Midenhall. It
contains a TOMBOLA TICKET. You can also access a Jail to the northeast if you
want to check that out, though you cannot do anything there at the moment.

In Leftwyne, using your Silver Key on the door in the Equipment Shop gives you
access to the Tombola game. For the cost of a Tombola Ticket, you can play a
slot-machine type game. Check out the Tombola section of this walkthrough to
learn more.

When you are ready, head west and a bit south of Cannock to a Shrine, called
Gwaelin's Gate. The guy in here will ask you if you've been to the Shrine south
of Midenhall, which I will call the Midenhall Shrine. You can check that Shrine
out if you want, but there is nothing you can do or get there right now, except
talk to one guy. He mentions getting both the Silver Key and the Gold Key.
Nothing major.

Talk to the guards and they will let you pass. Go down the stairs. I call this
tunnel Cannock Tunnel. Anyway, follow the eastern tunnel south, then west to the
next stairs. The western tunnel leads to a dead-end island.

Head south past the trees and hills. Eventually you will see a town. Enter it.
