Your Princess is weak. She needs some levels. I recommend grinding around the
bridge just a few steps south of Moonahan. You may want to defend often with
her. Use Moonahan to rest, restock and save.

The area east of Moonahan has some new monsters. Badboons have high attack
power. Dragonfries can cast Sizz. Both types of monsters can easily kill a party
member if they gain up on one or if they get the jump on you. Be careful and
keep your HP high. If anybody dies, return to Moonahan immediately. Also, Smogs
can cast Fizzle on your party, but they are no big deal.

At level 8 the Prince learns Fizzle. Fizzle has a chance of preventing a group
of monsters from casting spells and costs 3 MP.

At level 2 the Princess learns Snooze, which has a chance of putting a group of
monsters to sleep and costs 2 MP. I strongly recommend using Snooze if you meet
up with 2 or 3 Badboons in a battle.

At level 4 the Princess learns Woosh. Woosh hits a group of monsters and is
generally stronger than Sizz, but it costs 4 MP to use. Since you are next to
Moonahan anyway, feel free to abuse this new spell.

Once the Princess is level 5 and you've earned 1302G, return to Moonahan and
sell the Hero's Chain Sickle for 247G. You should have 1549G, enough for a Steel
Broadsword, a Chimaera Wing (if you need one) and a stay at the Inn. Equip your
new weapon on the Hero.
