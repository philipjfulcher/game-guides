Welcome to Moonahan! The Equipment and Item Shops are to the southeast. North of
them is the Tombola game, and north of that is the House of Worship. The lady to
the right in the House of Worship serves as the Vault. The guy to the west will
save your game.

If you talk to the dog, it will follow you around while you are in town.

You probably do not have enough money to buy anything new here yet. However,
there is no need to worry about that because the next walk is fairly short and
the monsters are not terribly difficult. Buy a Chimaera Wing if you do not have
one. Also bring a couple Medicinal Herbs and a couple Antidotal Herbs just in
case. Leave the town.
