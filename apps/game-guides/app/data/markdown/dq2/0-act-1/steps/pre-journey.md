An option to load a Quick Save will be there if you have already done that.
Otherwise, Venture Forth!

Create a new adventure log and select the file you want to save at. Make a name
for the Hero that is eight characters or less, select your message speed, volume
levels and confirm.

Note : If you try to put in "Jesus" or "Christ" as the Hero's name, you will
       get a message saying you cannot choose that name. Shoot me an e-mail if
       you discover any more names that cannot be used and I will list them.


You get a little backstory concerning the events of Dragon Quest and what
happened after the Dragonlord's defeat. Then you get some cutscenes. Hargon's
monsters sack Moonbrooke Castle, killing the guards and the King. However, a
lone guard manages to escape. What becomes of the Princess is unknown.
