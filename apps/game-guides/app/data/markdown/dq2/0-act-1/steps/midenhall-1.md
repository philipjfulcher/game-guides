title: MIDENHALL 1
order: 1
---



The guard manages to get to Midenhall and delivers the bad news to the King
before dying. So Hargon is the main villain of this game. Now it's up to you,
son of the King of Midenhall and descendant of both Erdrick and the Hero/Gwaelin
from the original Dragon Quest, to defeat this self-styled "High Priest" to save
the rest of the world from his wrath.

We play as Mega Man this time? Last time, it was Mario! Why do these Heroes look
like protagonists from Nintendo games?

Follow the King down the stairs. He will tell you to seek out your companions
who are also of Erdrick's line, making them your relatives. Probably cousins.
Anyway, the King will give names for your relatives before asking you to
confirm. If you say "No," you can choose your own names for them.

Note : If you try to put in "Jesus" or "Christ" as a party member's name, you
       will get a message saying you cannot choose that name. Shoot me an e-mail
       if you discover any more names that cannot be used and I will list them
       in a future version.

Once their names are set, finish talking to the King, then open the Treasure
Chest next to you for a COPPER SWORD and 50G. You can use either the Item Menu
or the Misc. Menu to equip your new weapon.

To save with the King, simply walk out of the Castle through the southern exit
and re-enter.
