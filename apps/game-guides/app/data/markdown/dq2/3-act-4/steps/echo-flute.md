title: ECHO FLUTE
order: 5
---



Note: You need the Silver Key to do this part.

Enter the town and talk to the grandfather again to get the Ship.

Sail directly north of Rippleport. After a while you should see a sparkle in the
water. Search the spot to get the SUNKEN TREASURE. You can Zoom back to
Rippleport but I prefer sailing back for the EXP and gold.

Enter Rippleport and go to where the Grimlins were. Search the northwestern spot
here for a SEED OF STRENGTH. Once you have used it, talk to the grandfather
again. Head south with the Ship and use the Silver Key on the door. Give the guy
the Sunken Treasure and he will give you the ECHO FLUTE. Use the Echo Flute in a
particular location, and there will be an echo if there is a certain type of
item nearby.

If you know this game or if you are following this walkthrough, you do not need
the Echo Flute. I suggest you put the Windbraker and the Echo Flute in the Vault
to get a couple more spaces for items.
