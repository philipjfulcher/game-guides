title: TANTEGEL
order: 4
---



The land to the east of Rippleport is Alefgard, the country from the first game.
You can disembark on Alefgard and walk east to Tantegel if you want. However, I
suggest you stay in the sea because the monsters there give better amounts of
gold.

Follow the coast of Alefgard south, then east. Pass the bridge to your north,
then follow the water north where it goes inland. When you get to a fork in the
water, go northwest. The southern castle is the Dragonlord's Castle and the
northern castle is Tantegel.

Anyway, enter Tantegel.

Note : You must have the Silver Key to access the Draper's Shop.

Welcome to Tantegel. See the green guy to the west? Talk to that guy and he will
ask you about the Sunken Treasure. Answer "Yes" to his question. Talk to him
again and this time answer "No." This trigger should make a sparkle appear north
of Rippleport, showing you the location of the Sunken Treasure.

There is an old man next to a pot. Talk to this guy if you are Cursed and he
will remove it. Search the pot for a HOLY WATER.

If you have the Silver Key, enter the shop to the north. This is the Draper's
Shop. The lady here will ask if you are looking for the Celestial Skein, an item
which you need to make an excellent armour. She suggests that you look in the
North Tower of the Dragon's Horns. This trigger should make a sparkle appear in
the North Tower so you can easily find it.

Leave Tantegel and Zoom to Rippleport.
