title: DRAGON'S HORN
order: 2
---

Walk, Zoom or use a Chimaera Wing to get back to Moonahan to rest, restock and
save. Grab the Iron Lance for the Prince from the Equipment Shop and sell his
Chain Sickle if you have not already done so. Buy the Full Plate Armour and
Steel Shield for the Hero and sell his Chain Mail and Leather Shield. If you do
not have the gold, go to the hills south of Moonahan and grind there until you
do.

At level 8 the Princess learns Holy Protection. It works like a Holy Water,
removing weak encounters for a number of steps.

The next journey is a bit long but you should be fine. Make sure you bring your
Windbraker along.

From Moonahan, cross the bridge and head west towards Moonbrooke. Cross the
bridge west of Moonbrooke and enter the Shrine, which I'll call the Moonbrooke
Shrine.

In the Moonbrooke Shrine is a House of Worship. As you cross the bridge a "!"
will appear above your head. That is because there is a hidden door in the
blackness. Unfortunately you do not have the right key. Exit via the western
stairs.

In this area you can run into Chewlips. Watch out for their Sickly-Sweet Breath
which can put your party to sleep. Since that move is an ability and not a
spell, they can use it an unlimited amount of times.

The Prince learns Evac at level 14 and the Princess learns Kasap at level 10. If
you are in a dungeon or tower, you can warp to the entrance using Evac at a cost
of 6 MP. Kasap lowers the defense of a group of monsters at a cost of 2 MP.

Continue west until you see a desert. Cross northwest through the desert past an
oasis and you should see hills. Continue northwest past the hills and you should
eventually see two towers. These towers are known as the Dragon's Horns. Enter
the south tower.

DRAGON'S HORNS (SOUTH TOWER)

Note : During my playthrough, I was on a floor. I walked to the hole in the
middle. As I stepped on the hole, I got a battle encounter. The battle
screen appeared, faded, then re-appeared. I finished the battle like
normal. When it was over, I was back on the first floor. It's just a
weird thing that happened that I thought I should mention.

This tower is easy to navigate. Just keep circling the tower and don't fall in
the hole in the middle.

On Floor 4 and the floors above you can meet a couple of new monsters. Madusae
can cast Snooze and Kasap. Shamans can Fizzle your party.

Once you get to Floor 7, talk to the soldier if you want. Make sure someone in
your party has the Windbraker. Fall off the tower in the northern direction. Be
careful not to fall off on the western side.

If you did it right, you should be on the north side of the river between the
Horns.
