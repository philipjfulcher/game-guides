Make sure you have at least 2000G, then head to the western Item Shop. Select
the ???. The merchant will ask if you can pay for it. Choose "Yes" and 2000G
will be deducted from your gold. Check your Items. You should have the JAILOR'S
KEY in your possession.

Next, head to the house directly north of the western Item Shop. Talk to the guy
to learn about Don Calico, a master weaver who lives in a town called Slewse. He
can make an excellent armour for you if you give him the proper materials.

Last, go to the building north of the House of Worship. You can enter it if you
go east as if you are going through a wall. Talk to the soldier to learn that
Roge Fastfinger, a thief, seems to have escaped his Jail cell. Talk to the guy
in the western cell to learn that Hargon lies beyond a territory called
Rendarak.

Open the eastern cell door. From the northeasternmost square, go south 1 step,
then east 1 step. You will find Roge Fastfinger. Talk to him and he will give
you the FLOODGATE KEY.

Forget about buying an Iron Helmet. You get a better one coming up soon. The
rest of the equipment here is probably too expensive for you right now. Once you
are ready, Zoom back to Midenhall.
