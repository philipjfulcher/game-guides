title: SHIP SAILING
order: 8
---



Sell the Full Plate Armour if you did the Dragonlord's Castle. Also, if you gave
the Erdrick's Sword to the Prince as suggested, sell his Iron Lance.

If you can afford it, buy a Wizard's Staff for 4000G, give it to the Princess
and sell her Divine Dagger. The Wizard's Staff, if used as an item in battle,
can shoot flames dealing damage to a group of monsters. It does about the same
damage as a Sizz spell, but costs no MP to use and can be used even when
Fizzled. Abuse it as much as you want.

The next part includes quite a bit of sailing, so make sure you are healed up to
full and bring some Medicinal Herbs just in case.

Zoom to Midenhall and start sailing southwest. You might meet a new monster.
Gargoyles can cast Fizzle and have a strong physical attack, but give good
experience.

Follow the coast south until the coast turns east. Press X to access your map.
See that flashing square directly south of you? This is the Shrine of Rubiss.
But you do not need to go there until you have all the Sigils. Instead, head to
the island southeast of this Shrine.

From the Shrine of Rubiss, head south until you get to the island. Take the
river into the interior of the island and enter the Castle. This is the Castle
of Dirkandor. Once you enter, immediately exit the Castle and return to the
Ship. Now that you have entered the town once, you can Zoom back here anytime
you want.

Press X to view your map. The square southwest of you is a cave you cannot enter
yet. Ignore it for now and continue south to another square. This is the Fire
Shrine.

Enter the Fire Shrine and you should see a sparkle to the northeast. Search the
sparkle to get the SUN SIGIL. One down, four to go. Exit the Fire Shrine.

Note : The Sun Sigil is not in your item list. Instead, a symbol representing
       the Sigil appears on every characters' status screens.

From the Fire Shrine, sail west and a bit south to find an island with some
trees in the middle, which I will call Yggdrasil Island. Search the trees to
find a YGGDRASIL LEAF. This leaf can be used to revive a dead party member to
maximum HP. However, note that you can only hold one at a time.

West of this island is a peninsula. Follow the southern coast west until you
come across a town. Enter and exit. Now you have the Zoom point for Burrowell.

Note : If you use your Yggdrasil Leaf, Zoom to Burrowell, sail east to Yggdrasil
       Island and grab another.

Sail east and a bit south until you are south of Yggdrasil Island. Go about 10
steps south of the island, then sail directly east. You should soon find a
couple of islands with a town next to a Shrine. Enter the town.

Head northeast and talk to the dog. He moves and a sparkle appears. Search the
sparkle to get the GOLD KEY. Leave town and Zoom to Burrowell.
