Welcome to Slewse! Make sure you have the Celestial Skein and the Subtle Shuttle
on you. Head northwest to a building with a gold-rimmed door. Use your Gold Key
on the door and head down the stairs. Talk to the guy. You have found Don
Calico! Since you already have the items he is looking for, he will take them
off your hands.

Note : Without the Silver Key, you cannot trigger the sparkle in the Dragon's
       Horn North Tower, which makes the Celestial Skein difficult to locate.

Now you must save normally, reset the game and go back into your file. Slewse
does not have a Save Point, so you need to Zoom to a town that does. Once you
have reloaded your file, Zoom back to Slewse and head back to Don Calico. Your
new armour should be ready. For your efforts, you receive a FLOWING DRESS. I
suggest equipping it on the Princess, but the Hero and the Prince are also able
to wear it.

If you have at least 3300G, sell the Prince's Cloak of Evasion as well as the
one the Princess was wearing (if you equipped her with the Flowing Dress) for
2700G and buy a Magic Armour for the Prince. It lowers any Magic damage you
receive by 25%. You can get a free Magic Armour for the Hero a little later. If
you don't have the gold, try grinding outside of Slewse. If the monsters around
there are too difficult, Zoom to Tantegel and grind in the water or inside the
Dragonlord's Castle.

Head to the Item shop east of the Inn. Hug the wall of the Item Shop as you head
north, then head west until you are northwest of the Inn. Use your Jailor's Key
on the door to the building here and head downstairs.

Take 1 step east and use your Floodgate Key. You have to go into your Item Menu
in order to use it. With that, the Floodgates are opened, giving you better
access to Slewse from the sea. Also, you now have access to the Tower of the
Moon to the south of Slewse. I recommend you take care of other business first
as the Tower is difficult at your current levels and with your current
equipment.

Instead, Zoom to Dirkandor.
