title: DIRKANDOR
order: 13
---



Around Dirkandor you can find Hawk Men, Metal Slimes, Sorcerers, Walking
Corpses, Miasmas and Treevils. Treevils can lower your MP and cast Fizzle,
Sorcerers can cast Fizzle, Kabuff and Sizzle, Miasmas can Snooze and Dazzle you.
Metal Slimes have 100% resistance to all spells and have a high resilience, but
they give you plenty of experience if you are lucky enough to kill one.

Go north, ignoring the first past west. Follow the second path west and south.
Use your Gold Key on the door. Open the Treasure Chests next to the Equipment
Shop merchant to receive a TECTONIC PLATE and a DIVINE DAGGER. Equip the
Tectonic Plate. Backtrack to where you ignored the first path going west. Go
that way. Talk to the King between the two bunny girls. Answer "Yes" to his
question. After the talk, walk south to the centre of the Coliseum.

You will face off against a Striking Sabrecat. I don't consider this monster a
mini-boss. I suggest using physical attacks with the Hero and the Prince and
have the Princess use Kasap on the first turn. The Striking Sabrecat should go
down during the second turn.

Talk to the King again to receive the MOON SIGIL. Four down, only one to go. The
King becomes a Save Point. Now you can explore the rest of the town.

Sell the Divine Dagger and the Full Plate Armour. Store the Mark of Erdrick and
the Floodgate Key in the Vault. This is all we can do here, so leave town and
Zoom to Tantegel.
