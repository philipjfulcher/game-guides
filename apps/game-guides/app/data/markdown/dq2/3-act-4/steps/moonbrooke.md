Visiting Moonbrooke is entirely optional and has no treasure. Like Erdrick's
Cave in the original Dragon Quest, Moonbrooke is there to add to the story.
Also, if you are new to the game, you can get some useful information on what to
do and where to go next.

Make sure you have a Chimaera Wing in your inventory, then cross the bridge
south of Moonahan and head west to Moonbrooke.

The monsters here are the same ones you met up with before. Corpse Corporals can
cast Dazzle on your party, which makes your physical attacks inaccurate. You
could have met up with one south of Moonahan but they are much more common here.

Go north and talk to the flame. I am guessing it is the spirit of the former
King and the Princess's father. This is how you were supposed to know the
Princess was the dog.

The Treasure Chests here contain nothing.

To get to the inner courtyard and the stairs, go just outside the perimeter in
the northwestern part of the Castle and head south, hugging the Castle wall.
When you get to the southwestern corner, head northeast to the courtyeard and
head down the stairs.

Talk to the fallen guard and he will turn into a flame. Talk to him again and
the flame will disappear. Yeah, this was the clue as to what to do with Ra's
Mirror.

This is all you can do here. Leave Moonbrooke and either walk or use a Chimaera
Wing to return to Moonahan.
