title: DRAGONLORD'S CASTLE
order: 7

Zoom or sail to Tantegel. If you have 1783G, sell the Princess's Plain Clothes
and buy a Cloak of Evasion for her, leaving you enough gold for a stay at the
Inn. If not, sail around Tantegel or grind in the hills north of Rippleport
until you have it. Grab a few Medicinal Herbs from the Item Shop if you wish.
Bring your Silver Key if you have it.

Use the Ship and cross the water to get to the southern castle. This is the
Dragonlord's Castle, the final area of the first game.

Enter the Dragonlord's Castle. Head north and down the stairs.

**Floor B1**

On this floor are some new monsters. Sabrecats have low HP but have a chance of
attacking twice. Dragonflies can breathe fire on your party. Goregons have high
resilience and can cast Dazzle on your party. Cobra Kaisers have a chance of
poisoning you with their attacks. Mummy Boys do not do much other than attack,
and you have already met the Gremlins.

Follow the linear path to the stairs.

**Floor B2**

Follow another linear path to the stairs.

**Floor B3**

Walk counter-clockwise and go down either stairs you want. Both paths lead to
**Floor B4.**

**Floor B4**

Go up the ascending stairs in the middle of the room. Go up two more flights of
stairs and down a flight.

**Floor B3**

You should be in the centre of this room next to a Chest. Open it to get
ERDRICK'S SWORD. Give it to either the Hero or the Prince. My suggestion would
be the Prince.

If you are running low on HP, MP and supplies, you can Evac out now and go to
Tantegel to rest and restock. You are going to need some MP for healing in the
next part coming up and a few Medicinal Herbs could be useful. Either way, find
your way back to floor B4.

**Floor B4**

This time, go down the descending stairs in the middle of the room.

**Floor B5**

Follow the path south, west, then north to more stairs.

**Floor B6**

Head east and down the stairs.

**Floor B7**

There are no encounters on this floor.

Head north, west, then follow the narrow path north, east, south and finally
west. Talk to the Dragonlord.

Oh. It is the great, great grandson. Answer "Yes" to his question. He tells you
that you need to collect five Sigils and take them to an island south of where
Cantlin used to be.

Note : You must have the Silver Key to do the next part.

Head back towards the entrance of this room. Make sure you have Medicinal Herbs
and MP for healing. See those diagonally-striped blue-and-white squares? These
are what I call Damage Tiles. Each party member will lose 14 HP a step if they
step on these tiles.

Head north from the entrance into the Damage Tiles. Heal your party every two
steps you take. When you get to the northern side, use your Silver Key on the
door. Open the Treasure Chests for ~156G, ~983G, SEED OF STRENGTH, and some FULL
PLATE ARMOUR. Evac out and return to Tantegel.
