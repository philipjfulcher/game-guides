Head northwest where the Equipment Shop and Item Shop is. You should be able to
see two monsters next to a lady. Don't go west of the Shops' entrances. Instead,
go south to the Item Shop and buy Banishing Bells for everybody. Banishing Bells
gives your party members more resistance to Snooze and Fizzle. Equip them.

If you have 1508G left, sell the Prince's Chain Mail and buy him a Cloak of
Evasion. If not, do not worry about it right now.

Quick Save. Now approach the monsters for a battle.

| This battle should not be hard. Gremlins can cast Heal and Snooze. If you    |
| equipped Banishing Bells on everyone, your party members will be more        |
| resistant to Snooze. Watch out for their Fire Breath attack, which damages   |
| all party members. Keep everyone's HP above 30 and take them out with your   |
| physical attacks or your spells.                                             |

Once the battle is over, you will be taken to see her grandfather. As a token of
gratitude he will let you borrow his Ship. Also, he suggests you visit Tantegel
to the east. Get in the Ship.

If you have the Silver Key, open the door to the south. The guy there will give
you a reward if you find his Sunken Treasure. Now head north and east along the
narrow waterway here and you will find yourself outside of Rippleport with the
Ship.

In the sea you will find Man o' Wars, Merluscs and Hawk Men. Man o' War has a
chance of putting someone to sleep with its attacks. Merluscs can use
Sickly-Sweet breath an unlimited number of times to potentially put your party
to sleep. Hawk Men hit hard with their attacks and can Heal, so be sure to keep
your HP high.
