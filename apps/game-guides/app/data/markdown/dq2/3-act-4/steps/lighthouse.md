After all that, it's time to do another Tower and gain some gold and experience.
The Lighthouse is on an island south of Tantegel. With your new equipment, the
Lighthouse should be easy. Use your map to locate it. When you are ready, start
sailing south to the island and enter the Lighthouse.

Talk to the guard if you want, then head up the stairs and inside the Tower.



**Floor 1F**


In this Tower are a couple of new monsters. Deadnauts do nothing special. Orc
Chieftains can cast Heal. Nothing you cannot handle.

Head east and north. Ignore the first path leading west and take the second.
Head north through the opening in the wall and continue west to the northwestern
corner, ignoring another path south. From the corner, head south, ignoring all
paths east until you reach the southwestern corner.

See that building to the northeast? Walk to the east side of the building and go
north until you are about 5 steps away from the northeast corner of the
building. Walk west into the side of the building. Exit through the northern
side to a Treasure Chest that contains ~560G.

From here head south past a room with stairs to another room with stairs. Take
these stairs up to the next level.



**Floor 2F**


Head south and ascend a flight of stairs.



**Floor 3F**


Head east and ascend another flight of stairs.



**Floor 4F**


Head north and ascend yet another flight of stairs.



**Floor 5F**


Grab the Treasure Chest here. It contains a CHAIN SICKLE. Backtrack to Floor 1F.



**Floor 1F**


From here, head 1 room west and ascend the stairs.



**Floor 2F**


Follow the path west and south to the stairs.



**Floor 3F**


Passing by the stairs, head into the wall to the north to ascend five flights of
stairs.



**Floor 8F**


Talk to the soldier to learn more about Rendarak. Other than that, there is
nothing here. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



**Floor 3F**


Head south and west to ascend the stairs you passed earlier.



**Floor 4F**


Head south into the wall and grab the Treasure Chest. It contains ~706G. Head up
the nearby stairs.



**Floor 5F**


Head east into the wall and up the stairs.



**Floor 6F**


Head north and descend the next stairs.



**Floor 5F**


Finally, head west to a Treasure Chest to receive a SEED OF LIFE. Backtrack to
**Floor 4F.**



**Floor 4F**


Head east and north. Ignore the eastern stairs. Instead, take the western
stairs. Be careful not to fall off the Tower. Use Quick Save if you wish.



**Floor 5F**


Head east to the stairs. You can walk over the rock.



**Floor 6F**


Use your Gold Key on the door, then go to the northwestern stairs.



**Floor 7F**


Head east. You should see a Gremlin going south into the wall. Do that now. Talk
to the old man. Follow him wherever he goes. Quick Save often and be careful
about falling off the Tower. The old man will lead you down five flights of
stairs.



**Floor 2F**


Talk to the old man, then attempt to open the Treasure Chest. There is nothing
inside... wait a second. It's a trap!

Four Gremlins will attack you, but they should be easy at this point.

For defeating them, you get the STAR SIGIL. That should be all five. However,
there is one more item you need to open the Cave to Rendarak. Actually, it's two
items because you need one to get the other one. Now you can cast Evac to get
out of here.
