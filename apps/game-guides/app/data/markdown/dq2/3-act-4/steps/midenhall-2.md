title: MIDENHALL 2
order: 10

Enter the room to the east, then head south to the Treasure Chests. They contain
SEED OF LIFE, MEDICINAL HERB, ~1146G, SEED OF STRENGTH, SEED OF MAGIC and the
MARK OF ERDRICK. The Mark of Erdrick can be used to obtain a helmet later in the
game.

Note : You need the Silver Key for the next part.

Go back into the building but this time, use your Silver Key on the door and
head north to the Jail.

Unlock the northern cell and the guy will tell you the King of Alefgard has the
Soul Sigil. Unlock the door to the south. Make sure you are fully healed on HP
and MP. Go south 2 steps, unlock the southern cell door and walk all the way
west. Each party member will receive 28 damage, so heal them back up. Look south
and press A to find a SEED OF AGILITY. Press Y to use the Menu instead of A
because you don't want to talk to the guy until you use your Seed.

Once you use it, make sure the Hero has some Medicinal Herbs on him. Quick Save
and talk to the guy. Oh wait... it's a monster!

| This battle may take several tries. Attack with the Hero, defend with the    |
| Prince and cast Dazzle with the Princess on the first turn. I would not use  |
| the Fizzle spell on him. The reason is because he has a buff and a debuff    |
| spell which do no damage to your party. In this battle, you need this monster|
| to waste turns casting these spells. If the Wrecktor is Fizzled, it will stop|
| trying to cast these spells and start using physical attacks, which hit hard.|
|                                                                              |
| During the next few turns, have the Hero attack, the Prince healing or       |
| defending and the Princess healing or defending. The Hero may have to use    |
| some Medicinal Herbs if the monster uses Kaboom. If you can get away with    |
| casting a Kasap, go for it. Keep trying, and with a combination of strategy  |
| and dumb luck, it should eventually go down.                                 |
|                                                                              |
| For your troubles you get 968 EXP, 170G and a LIGHTNING STAFF. Victory!      |

| Note : As there are no other monsters aiding the Wrecktor, he will not cast  |
|        Kazing.                                                               |

If used as an item in battle, the Lightning Staff is generally more powerful
than the Wizard's Staff. It hits a group of monsters. I suggest equipping the
Lightning Staff on the Princess and giving the Wizard's Staff to the Prince.
Keep Erdrick's Sword equipped on the Prince if you chose to do so earlier; in
that situation, the Wizard's Staff is to be used only as an item in battle. If
the Hero has Erdrick's Sword, equip the Wizard's Staff on the Prince.

Heal up, then walk through the damage tiles and up the stairs. Rest at the Inn
if you want, then leave town.
