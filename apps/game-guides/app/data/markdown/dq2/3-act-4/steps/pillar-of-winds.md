title: PILLAR OF WINDS
order: 1
---

At level 10 the Prince learns Zoom. At a cost of 1 MP, it will teleport you to
any town you have already been in. In the NES version, the spell Return would
return you to the place you last saved. But in the Switch/Mobile versions, you
can select your town of choice.

Rest at the Inn and make sure you have a Chimaera Wing and a few Medicinal or
Antidotal Herbs. If you cannot afford an Iron Lance for the Prince, do not
worry. The upcoming tower is the first real dungeon of the game, but it is not
that difficult.

I suggest you save your Sizz and Woosh spells for groups of 3 or more monsters
during the next journey.

Head northwest of Moonahan through the forest. Ignore the first bridge and
continue north. Cross the next bridge and start heading south along the coast.
When you get to a river, cross the first bridge you see and continue south.
Cross three more bridges and head west to the Pillar of Winds.

**Floor 1F**

You will come across a new monster in this tower. Dirty Rats can call other
Dirty Rats to battle.

Head south past the stairs until you see a Treasure Chest. Open it for a
MEDICINAL HERB. Return to the stairs and this time head east and north to more
stairs.

**Floor 2F**

Be very careful. If you fall off the tower, you will have to start over from
**Floor 1F. Quick Save is useful at a time like this.**

Talk to the soldier if you want, then head west to go up another flight of
stairs.

**Floor 3F**

Head south and get the Treasure Chest. It contains ~321G. Head up the stairs to
the south.

**Floor 4F**

On this floor and the floors above you can run into Killipedes. They have good
resilience and can hit you with a grievous attack, the monster version of a
critical hit.

I suggest tapping on the directional pad to keep yourself from falling off. Take
2 steps south, then head east and ascend the first stairs you see.

**Floor 5F**

Head west and north, being very careful as you turn the corner. Head down the
stairs.

**Floor 4F**

Head down the stairs next to you.

**Floor 3F**

Head down the stairs next to you.

**Floor 2F**

Press A next to the item to receive a WINDBRAKER. This accessory will move you
an extra two squares if you fall off a tower. The direction you move depends on
which direction you fall off. Now go back to the southern part of Floor 4F.

**Floor 4F**

Head east and up the stairs.

**Floor 5F**

Tap the directional pad once to go east 1 square, then head north to the stairs.

**Floor 6F**

Head to the northwestern stairs.

**Floor 7F**

Take the stairs next to you.

**Floor 8F**

Open the Chest to receive a PRAYER RING. It restores your MP but breaks after a
few uses. I recommend putting it in a Vault to save it for the end of the game.
If you still have HP and MP left, you can grind for a bit on the top floor. Once
you are completely drained, go back down the steps.

**Floor 7F**

Go north one step to fall off the tower. You are done with the Pillar of Winds.
