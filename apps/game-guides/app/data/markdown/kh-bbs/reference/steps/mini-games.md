\   /  Command Board                                                     [1701]


Command Boards are mini-games played like a board game where players compete
against NPC opponents in a race to a certain amount of game points (GP). At the
start of each turn you roll a die and move that number in a certain direction.
The basic idea is to pass the checkpoints and return to the start panel in order
to receive a bonus. After obtaining the targeted amount of GP simply return to
the start panel to win the game.

You can play cards from your hand to use special abilities or use the cards on
panels that you land on. Much like Monopoly, if a player lands on a panel that
you own then they pay a toll for landing there based on the level of the panel.
You obtain new cards when you pass a checkpoint and get them all refilled if you
return to the start panel after passing all four checkpoints. Your GP doesn't go
to waste when you spend it, rather you have an overall total that you use to
determine whether or not you can win -- be aggressive on spending it.

You can earn a various amount of rewards from playing the Command Board. You
gain a lot of command points (CP) from the commands you play on panels after the
game ends based on the level of the panel and where you placed. You can also
land on Bonus Panels and acquire new commands all together, some that are rare
and can only be obtained via the Command Board.

\   /  Rumble Racing                                                     [1702]


There is a total of four race courses available for play in this mini-game.
You can play it in either Disney Town or at the Mirage Arena to unlock more
tracks or earn prizes or medals.

Tips on being successful:

- Get a good start. Press X after the 1 has faded away on the countdown but
just before the word "Go!" appears to start off in full speed.
- Take turns with X and Square to turn sharply without losing speed.
- Play defensive. When you are "Locked On" hit Triangle to guard and don't
attack players in front of you unless you know you can hit them.
- Snag the shields. They will help you finish the race without getting stopped
by your opponent.
- Lastly, take the shortcuts. Taking the fastest way through the course will
almost certainly guarantee victory.

|  Stick close to the right wall and hit the first ramp to hit the shortcut.   |

|  Start off just like you do in Country Chase, taking the mountain pass then  |
| as you come in to the city launch off the ramp and hit the midair dash ring. |
| There is a ramp on the right side that sends you on a narrow pass, hook a    |
| very sharp right to take a shortcut. Be sure to grab the shield in the tunnel|
| to ensure safety on the way to the finish line.                              |

|  The key point to this race is the shield on the ledge after the initial ramp|
| because it gives you enough invulnerability to launch through the tornado at |
| the end. As you come off the mountain pass you can continue straight to grab |
| another shield to take you home.                                             |

|  Right off the start is where you can win or lose the race. Hang a sharp left|
| at the initial split then slow down enough to hit the ramp around the corner.|
| This will propel you in to a shortcut in the middle of the fenced off area.  |
| Once you reach the bottom you will be forced left or right. If you go right  |
| then stay your course, if left then make sure to hit both ramps to be on the |
| optimal course. Hit all the dashes to stay well ahead and get an extra jolt  |
| after each lap with the midair dashes.                                       |

In this mini-game you are on an ice cream cannon that blasts ice cream at the
three ducklings, Huey, Duey, and Louie. The objective is to mimic their beat
to obtain a high score. There are five songs in total and you earn points for
being well timed. A "Good" results in 20 points, "Excellent" for 40 points, and
"Bad" results in a combo breaker as well as knocking some ice cream off the
stacks. After a 20 combo points will double and periodically you will get a
chance to rapid-fire and increase your combo. There are two levels to each song,
Beginner and Master, while the latter is unlocked by scoring "Cool" or higher
on the Beginner mode. On Master you can earn prizes for scoring "Fantastic"
which usually requires you to score "Good" on almost every clap. The [FROZEN
FORTUNE COMMAND STYLE] is the greatest of prizes for this mini-game.

This mini-game is also played in Disney Town and is basically a mix between
soccer and volleyball. The objective to is smack a ball in to the opponents
goal which is usually moving around. You can jump with Circle, swing your
Keyblade with X, have a curving shot with Square, or use Triangle to bump the
ball up for a spike. You can guide the fruit where you want by moving the analog
in that direction. During the harder matches the goal will be floating, this is
a good time to play defense. Fruits can break and leave the player stunned or
the ground littered with excess. Rotate the analog to break out of stun faster
and spike the ball on your opponent to try and stun them, allowing for easier
goals.

This is a mini-game played at the Olympus Coliseum. The objective is to break
more urns and earn more points than Hercules. Little urns are worth 1 and big
ones are worth 5. You can use barrels to score points faster or simply use a
few ultimate commands like Quake or Mega Flare to wipe the whole board clean
and score a ton of points.

The first time you win you will receive [SONIC BLADE], consecutive wins result
in a [PANACEA].
