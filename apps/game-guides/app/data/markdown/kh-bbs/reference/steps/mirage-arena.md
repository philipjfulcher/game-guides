title: Mirage Arena
order: 4
---


The Mirage Arena is a great place to do a lot of things and earn great prizes
for them. This is also the only place where you can play in multiplayer. The
main focus of this section will be on the Arena Mode which pits you (and your
friends if on multiplayer) against some of the hardest challenges in the game.
While playing in the Mirage Arena you will earn Medals, a new form of currency
only for use in this area. In order to spend it on most of the prizes available
you must first raise your Arena Level. There are a few ways to raise your Arena
Level:

- Complete an Arena Mode challenge (15)
- Complete a Rumble Racing Target Time (4)
- Win a Command Board game (4)
- Earn a set amount of Medals; 300, 1000, 3333, 5555, 7777, 9999 (6)

You can earn 15% more medals while playing with multiple players. You can
also bring along a Group ability and use it during battle, such as a Group Cure,
to earn the same effect by tricking the system. Remember that to unlock the
Rumble Racing courses you must do so in Disney Town and then beat the target
time in the Mirage Arena.

General tips for Arena Mode:

- Equip at least one level 6 Command.
- Equip at least one area of effect Command.
- Equip at least one Curaga
- Don't equip attack style movements (Ice Slide, Sonic Impact)
- Equip fast locking Shotlocks
- Equip Vanish if you have it
- Stay mobile and stick to your guns
- Pick out the strongest enemies in each group. Tank Topplers, Mandrakes, and
Chrono Twisters fall in to this group. Buckle Bruisers and Wild Bruisers can
also be a nuisance, use magic attacks to quickly devastate them (Mega Flare)

|  The Iron Imprisoner will fly around in a cauldron with his arms locked.    |
| Since most of his attacks will negate your combos it is recommended to let  |
| him initiate and then counter. The easiest attack to counter is the lasers, |
| simply jump over them and combo for some decent damage then slide out in to |
| safety. The Iron Imprisoner's melee attack can be blocked and countered so  |
| you can get some more damage out of this attack. The other attacks should be|
| avoided completely and they are his fiery spinning move and the underground |
| explosion. Dodge these attacks with Slide, Dodge Roll, or Cartwheel and wait|
| for the Iron Imprisoner to use easier attacks to counter. When you get put  |
| in the cage simply do as much damage as possible to break out quickly. Bust |
| out a Shotlock during the lasers or when you have enough distance for some  |
| decent damage and invulnerability.                                          |

| off a few hits as it lands by jumping and swinging. The Wheel Master will   |

|  The Iron Imprisoner II functions much like the first with the exception of |
| it's arms being freed. The melee attack is now a three hit combo which can  |
| be blocked and then countered with your own combo. The fiery spin is now    |
| noticeably faster and hard to dodge. Try using Vanish or a Shotlock to be   |
| invulnerable during this period of time. Everything else functions like the |
| previous Iron Imprisoner.                                                   |

|  The Mimic Master has an arsenal of attacks that can either be countered for|
| major damage or leave you devastated depending on how you react. The most   |
| common is the rotating white and black beams he will summon. While the white|
| books do minimal damage the black ones will blind you. You can't run from   |
| the Mimic Master during this time so your best bet is to dodge the beams and|
| get a few hits in while you can, use Esuna if you have it to cure blind.    |
| The Mimic Master will also light itself on fire and flying around after you |
| for medium damage. Dodge this attack and wait for it to end, counter it with|
| a Shotlock since the Mimic Master will take time to rest afterwards.        |
|                                                                             |
|  Perhaps the hardest part of this fight is when the Mimic Master summons a  |
| multitude of cards and clones. Each card that is destroyed will be gone for |
| good, each card that is not destroyed will spawn a new clone once you defeat|
| it. The best way to get out of this is an area of effect attack like Mega   |
| Flare. You can also use Vanish and destroy most of the cards before taking  |
| out the clones. When the Mimic Master resurfaces use your Shotlock to get   |
| good damage done and hopefully finish the fight.                            |

|  As with the original fight focus on taking out the legs first with high    |
| level commands or a Shotlock. Move on to the arms only after the legs have  |
| been dealt with and watch out for the sweeping energy beams. You can dash   |
| through them to get behind the boss and deal some good close range damage.  |
| Trinity Armor will separate itself after the first wave of energy beams, be |
| sure to keep your distance so that you can dodge the barrage of attacks.    |
| Once the limbs are gone pummel the body to end the fight.                   |

|  The Iron Imprisoner III is out of it's gibbet but not too much has changed |
| from the previous version. The laser attack has disappeared but the melee   |
| combo has extended to four swings. Counter this attack to stun the boss and |
| get some damage in. Fiery spin returns stronger and faster, but this time   |
| the Iron Imprisoner III will not follow you, rather it will dash around the |
| arena leaving you time to dodge. Sometimes the boss will glow black and     |
| begin creating explosions, you can block this attack just the same as the   |
| melee and get the same result -- a stun that leaves the boss wide open. The |
| Blade Charge Command Style will let you continually strike until you use the|
| finish command and Shotlock/Vanish are still awesome for invulnerability as |
| well as damage output.                                                      |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  The basis of this fight is to take out Zack before he kills you with Hero's|
| Pride. A strong Shotlock off the start, like Bio Barrage, should do a good  |
| job at denting his armor. Keep your distance from Hades and continue to     |
| strike at Zack until he goes down. Hades should be cake from here, the use  |
| of Shotlock works well. If you can slide behind Hades you can land a few    |
| good combos which should be more than enough to take him down.              |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  This fight is incredibly easy compared to the earlier fight. Tear in to    |
| the Ice Colossus and trigger the Firestorm Command Style to inflict extra   |
| damage. As long as you stay close to it's feet the Ice Colossus won't use   |
| it's most devastating attack and should fall quickly.                       |

|  A few new attacks are added to the Iron Imprisoner IV. Teleporting and     |
| drawing you in then leaving an explosion in the void it will teleport and   |
| repeat. You can dodge both the initial draw and the explosion. The screen   |
| will go red from time to time and fragments will start flying around. The   |
| Iron Imprisoner will isn't present during this time so it's simple to dodge |
| this attack. The fiery spin and black glowing explosion combo make a return |
| and can be used at any time, regardless of the Iron Imprisoner's HP. The    |
| only real chance you have to deal any damage safely is a Shotlock after the |
| cage attack or as he finishes his spin.                                     |

|  The first part of the battle is actually inside of Monstro. Here you'll    |
| have to deal with Unversed that must be defeated to free yourself. Once you |
| are freed you'll have just three minutes to deal as much damage as possible.|
| The main strategy is to hit Monstro with the explosive barrels that are     |
| located on the islands. This will cause Monstro to dizzy out and leave his  |
| tongue hanging, a platform for which you can deal damage. Monstro will fire |
| waves at you which you'll need to dodge through in order to avoid. When he  |
| launches his whole body on the middle platform use a command like Magic     |
| Hour to avoid the damage and start a mini-assault.                          |
|                                                                             |
|  Monstro can also launch himself over the middle island, this is a good     |
| opportunity to hit him with a barrel and possible dizzy him. After the time |
| runs out you'll be swallowed again, each time increases the stomach acid so |
| you'll have less and less space for safe fighting. Monstro's last attack is |
| a vacuum-like attack where he attempts to inhale you. Simply Air Slide in   |
| opposite direction to avoid being sucked in or, better yet, hit a barrel in |
| the vacuum to deal damage.                                                  |

| Phase I - Terra                                                             |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                             |
|  The Armor of Eraqus is one of the toughest fights in the game. It is the   |
| remnants of Master Eraqus and fights much the same. The fight is broken     |
| into two phases for his attack patterns, the first phase utilizes a unique  |
| fighting style depending on the character you are playing as. While playing |
| as Terra, the Armor of Eraqus uses Critical Impact and Rockbreaker          |
| Command Styles where he uses a multitude of downward slashes that create    |
| shockwaves, it's ultimate move will bind Terra and pull a chunk of the area |
| up then blast it with light. This attack requires you to continously press  |
| the displayed button to break free of the chains or take the full force of  |
| this vicious attack.                                                        |
|                                                                             |
| Phase I - Ventus                                                            |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                            |
|  When playing as Ventus the Armor of Eraqus fights using the Fever Pitch    |
| Command Style, performing flying slashes similar to Stratosphere and  Air   |
| Dive. Often you'll need to withstand a long powerful combo from the Armor   |
| of Eraqus via the Keyblade. Use Payback Raid to deal damage and  get some   |
| invincibility between assaults, make sure to heal. The ultimate attack here |
| is several tornados, just Dodge Roll past them.                             |
|                                                                             |
| Phase I - Aqua                                                              |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                              |
|  When playing as Aqua the boss uses the Spellweaver Command Style and uses  |
| a lot of Barrier Surge attacks, the finishing blow is a magic bubble. Some  |
| of the attacks like the Fire Pillars, require you to repeatedly Cartwheel   |
| away. The Dancing Lights attack, where the Armor of Eraqus surrounds itself |
| with moving light energy, requires you to Cartwheel in large circles with   |
| accurate timing. The ultimate move here summons different colors of light   |
| onto quadrants of the area, you'll need to Cartwheel out of harms way       |
| constantly. They each inflict different status effects, but it's best to    |
| treat them all as deadly.                                                   |
|                                                                             |
| Phase II                                                                    |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                    |
|  This phase begins when the Armor of Eraqus ensnares the character with a   |
| seal. When this happens, rotate the control stick to break free. If you     |
| try to attack you'll end up getting stunned. The speed of the boss will     |
| increase and several quick slashes like Zantetsuken. Begin using Shotlocks  |
| more regularly during this phase, it helps prevent getting stunned. When    |
| the seal on it's back goes away, the Armor of Eraqus will return to         |
| Phase I for the respective character. The battle will continue switching    |
| between these two phases. It's easy to get stunned during this phase so     |
| block and use Shotlock until Phase I starts again.                          |
|                                                                             |
| How to Counter                                                              |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                              |
|  When Armor of Eraqus fires magical orbs you can simply reflect them        |
| back. This attack is given away by the lack of movement and noticable build |
| up to it. For Dancing Lights, just move far away and you'll be able to      |
| ignore the attack completely as it is limited. The Keyblade Seeker attack   |
| is best guarded against, it's the attack where Armor of Eraqus launches     |
| Keyblades from a spiral center. The Fire Pillars are able to be guarded or  |
| just dodge rolled away from. You can avoid the Ensnare attack, it is fired  |
| three times but if you are caught then focus on guarding the powerful       |
| combo that follows. When Armor of Eraqus uses a combo watch for it to       |
| raise it's hand, this is the signal for Ensnare.                            |

|  The first phase starts with No Heart using his Keyblade to summon a wall   |
| that prevents you from getting in close. You'll want to use Shotlocks or    |
| Raging Storm to quickly destroy the Keyblade so you can get to the second   |
| and main part of the battle. Be sure to dodge the Keyblades that come       |
| flying at you and stay away from the dark void that attempts to suck you in |
| periodically. If you get caught you'll have to mash the displayed button to |
| break free of the wall that rapidly drains your health.                     |
|                                                                             |
| Phase II                                                                    |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                    |
|  No Heart doesn't have a set attack pattern, he constantly changes the      |
| shape of his Keyblade to use a different attack though. Your best bet in    |
| this battle is to block and counter. Attack Commands and Shotlocks won't    |
| help too much in this fight, but Thunder and Fire Surges are useful. Make   |
| sure to have an Esuna and a Potion/Mega-Potion in your Command Deck as well |
| since you'll be using them to avoid a slew of attacks.                      |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Impact                                                                 |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                 |
|  No Heart cloaks himself in darkness then launches into a double-dash       |
| similar to Terra's Sonic Impact. No Heart is invulnerable during this move  |
| but you can easily block it with a quick hit.                               |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Cannon                                                                 |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                 |
|  No Heart transforms the Keyblade into a cannon and fires three shots in    |
| several directions. It's easy to guard the initial one then dash in for a   |
| quick hit or two.                                                           |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Axis                                                                   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                   |
|  No Heart turns the Keyblade into a set of greaves and launches a six-hit   |
| combo that can be blocked and countered. Be sure to use your counter at the |
| end of the combo because the final kick is much stronger than the others.   |
|                                                                             |
| Windcutter                                                                  |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                  |
|  This attack is often used immediately following another combo. No Heart    |
| kicks off of a dash to fire a wave of dark energy, this can be blocked or   |
| dodged if you are quick enough on the recovery.                             |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Volley                                                                 |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                 |
|  No Heart fires multiple dark projectiles and Keyblades at you. These are   |
| easier to block with Aqua but it's best to just dodge.                      |
|                                                                             |
| Glider                                                                      |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                      |
|  Occasionally No Heart will turn his Keyblade into wings allowing him to    |
| rise into the area. He uses Dark Impact and Dark Volley in conjunction with |
| his new aerial ability to inflict damage more easily. You'll want to dodge  |
| during this part of the battle until No Heart descends.                     |
|                                                                             |
| Grapple                                                                     |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                     |
|  If you keep too close to No Heart he will eventually use this attack. It's |
| far too difficult to dodge but luckily you are given a button to press      |
| repeatedly to free yourself.                                                |
|                                                                             |
| Bursting Blow                                                               |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                               |
|  This attack is normally followed by Grapple. No Heart will toss you into   |
| the air and you will be suspended there. There is no dodging this attack,   |
| you are only left to withstand it. Be sure to recover afterwards.           |
|                                                                             |

|  A large pool of dark energy is created and if you stand in it for too long |
| your Deck Commands will slowly change to "Darkness Outflow". You'll want to |
| avoid using this command because each time you do there is a harsher status |
| effect; 1 use inflicts Blind, 2 inflicts Confuse, 3 uses causes Poison, and |
| 4 will trigger a 5 second Doom count.                                       |
|                                                                             |
| Displace Keyblade                                                           |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                           |
|  Occasionally the Keyblade will shift to the shield that it was in Phase I  |
| and guard No Heart. You cannot hurt him nor the Keyblade, only dodge the    |
| attacks.                                                                    |
|                                                                             |

| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                               |
|  This is a rarer attack where No heart fires a quick and sudden dark blast  |
| that will bind you. You can still attack and defend however, so guard       |
| against the attacks that will follow for the next few seconds.              |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Impact                                                                 |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                 |
|  At around 4 bars of HP left No heart will use this attack frequently. It   |
| is a quick ascension then crash into the ground to create a shockwave.      |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Pillar                                                                 |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                                 |
|  The Dark Pillar can alter your speed to either slow you down or speed you  |
| up. Obviously the latter is useful for dodging and countering but it's not  |
| worth the risk. Use Esuna to restore your original speed.                   |
|                                                                             |
| Dark Giga Flare                                                             |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                             |
|  This is No Hearts final and ultimate attack. He will hover in mid-air then |
| create an enormous explosion that will kill you unless you have Second      |
| Chance. It also resets Focus and Command gauges but items are not effected  |
| so use a Mega-Potion if you are hit. Luckily, it is possible to get to the  |
| far side of the area to dodge the attack completely, you just have to be    |
| quick enough. Watch out for the snake-like darkness that will track you on  |
| the ground, it inflicts Bind to make the attack sure to hit.                |
