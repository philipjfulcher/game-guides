After the opening scene search the area for three chests containing [CURE],
[PULSING CRYSTAL], and [BALLOON LETTER] then enter the tower. Open the chest
under the steps for a [MAGIC RECIPE] then head up the steps. After the scene

swinging the Keyblade. On the World Map head to the area listed as "???" for a
few brief scenes, afterwards head to the city of light, Radiant Garden.
