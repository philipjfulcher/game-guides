## Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall ##

After the scene leave the room in to the Vault. Search the bottom area for
two chests containing an [ETHER] and [BALLOON LETTER]. Near the second chest
is a fireplace that can be lit with any Fire command. Ride the bubbles that
appear to the top and grab the [FLAME SALVO] from the chest. Drop down to
another group of bubbles and ride them to another ledge. Defeat the Unversed and
open the nearby chest for a [POTION] and continue your way around this level
until you reach the Underground Waterway.

You should immediately notice the wheelshaped switch upon entering this area.
Hit it and dash through the gate that opens near where you entered. Open the
chest for a [POTION] then hit the next switch and dash through the next gate
located near where the first switch is. Beyond this gate is a chest with the
[BLOCK RECIPE], further beyond this gate is another leading to a [POISON EDGE]
and [FIRE]. As you empty those chests the Prize Pods will spawn next to you,
defeat them and return to the second switch location. Equip a dash command such
as Sliding Dash and look out on the ledge to the left. Jump straight up and use
the command at the peak of your jump to grab the [LOUIE STICKER].

Head to the Courtyard and open the chest for a [POTION]. Check out the shop
and open two more chests around the corner for [DWARF WOODLANDS MAP] and a
[SOOTHING CRYSTAL]. Leave through the southern door to meet Snow White, but you
are rudely interrupted by Unversed.

|-----------------------------------------------|
| DECK COMMAND   | Air Glide                    |



Equip Air Glide then open the chest for a [HUNGRY CRYSTAL] then grab the
[BALLOON STICKER]. Go back to the Courtyard and check out the archway to the
west. Find the one spot where there the bushes aren't covering and jump up on
to the archway. In the opposite corner is a chest holding [FISSION FIRAGA],
leap and use Sliding Dash at your highest point to reach it.


ULTIMATE COMMAND

With the acquisition of Fission Firaga you can create Mega
Flare, an awesome command especially at this point in the
game. Meld two Fires to make a Fira, then add another Fire
to make it Firaga. Meld a Firaga with Slow or Stop to create
Crawling Fire. Max out Crawling Fire and Fission Firaga and
combine them to create Mega Flare!


Make your way back to the starting room to trigger a cutscene and another
boss fight.

|  The Spirit of the Magic Mirror isn't that difficult. It can warp around the|
| battlefield but you can always do damage with Strike Raid (or any of it's   |
| many variations) or your Shotlock. When the Spirit duplicates they will all |
| hurl hordes of fireballs, dodge them by dashing. The real Spirit is the one |
| with a sly grin so when you find it be sure to unleash a deadly combo.      |

After the battle there will be another scene. When you are taken back to the
World Map a new area will be unveiled. Head to the Mysterious Tower when you're
ready, just make sure you are getting the rare commands from the Command Board
games and leveling up new commands constantly so as to forge more powerful ones
such as Firaga or Blizzaga.

## Unversed Mission - Survival Bottle ##

Location: Underground Waterway
Reward: Illusion S
1 Star: 0'00"00 - 0'59"59
2 Star: 1'00"00 - 1'59"59
3 Star: 2'00"00+

The trick here is to load up on a bunch of Cure commands and have a long
Shotlock like Meteor Shower or Ragnarok so you can reach the Survival Bottle.
The poison will kill you quickly so chase down the Survival Bottle and use
Finishers often since you are immune during them (same with Shotlocks). Use a
Cure when you can't reach the Survival Bottle in time and dash to keep up. Just
watch out when the Survival Bottle dashes at you, Guard then counter!
