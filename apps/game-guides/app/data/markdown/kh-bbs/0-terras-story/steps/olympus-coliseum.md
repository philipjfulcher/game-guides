## The Games, Games! ##

As per the usual, Unversed await as you enter this world. The one new Unversed
that could give problems is the Buckle Bruiser. You have to immobilize them or
get behind them in order to inflict damage. Move north to the Coliseum Gates and
after the scene check the corners and behind pillars to find three chests with
[MEGA-POTION], [MEGA ATTACK RECIPE], and [FIRE STRIKE] then behind another set
of pillars is the [BALLOON STICKER]. To reach it jump and swing the Keyblade,
then continue to the Vestibule.

Open the chest for the [OLYMPUS COLISEUM MAP] then talk to Hades to enter in
the games. If you don't feel confident in taking down enemies in a short amount
of time, equip a bunch of Magnet and Thunder commands to quickly group up and
destroy the masses. Shotlock will be good for Buckle Bruisers and Chrono Twister
since they are harder to kill. Rounds 7-8 you can use Shotlock if needed, on
Round 10 Magnet followed by Thunder should eliminate most of the Jellyshade.

After you win take some time to save and change your Command Deck back to your
preferred fighting style. The upcoming boss is vulnerable to a number of status
effects however, so a good strategy is to equip status inflicting attacks like
Freeze Raid, Stun Edge, and Ignite. Be sure to keep a healing command because
you can potentially take a lot of damage quickly. Talk to Hades to initiate the
next battle.

|  You will fight Zack twice consecutively and the first go around you can    |
| simply pummel him. During the second fight he will unleash the deadly Meteor|
| spell and lengthy combos that easily leave Terra in critical condition. Your|
| best bet is to stay on the offensive against Zack and keep him immobilized. |
| Shotlock is immensely recommended during this fight and healing should be   |
| top priority whenever you have less than full health. Leaf Bracer, an       |
| ability you most likely have by now, will allow you to heal more easily and |
| safer. Once More and Second Chance will also be more than helpful if you    |
| managed to get those abilities already. If you haven't then maybe you have  |
| Aqua's level 2 D-Link for Auto-Life which will also do the trick. Remember  |
| that immobilizing him is the key and use Shotlock to become immune during   |
| his combo attack.                                                           |

After defeating Zack you should return to the Coliseum to find Prize Pods in
the south east corner of the southern area, Town Near Thebes. You can also talk
to Hercules to participate in a mini-game and net a few new commands including
[SONIC BLADE]. Head over to Deep Space once you're all finished up.

## Unversed Mission - Shade Jelly ##

Location: Town Near Thebes
Reward: Stopga
1 Star: 1'00"00+
2 Star: 0'31"00 - 0'59"00
3 Star: 0'00"01 - 0'30"59

The trick here is to defeat all 300 Shade Jelly using clearing commands like
Magnega and Meteor, Mega Flare, Thundaga, etc... There really isn't much else to
it, just stack some heavy commands and go to town.
