## Getting to the Ball ##

After the scene Terra is thrust in to combat again. Defeat all the unversed
and leave the area via the southern exit to the Chateau. Here you will find
a [TRAFFIC CONE STICKER] and a chest containing [THUNDERSTORM]. Return to the
Forest and get to the Palace Courtyard where you will encounter plenty of
Unversed as well as four chests containing [SLOW], [CASTLE OF DREAMS MAP],
[PULSING CRYSTAL], and [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]. After defeating all the enemies
check the middle pond to spawn Prize Pods. As you head up the steps Cinderella
will ask Terra to escort her, stopping you from getting the last chest in this
area.

| DECK COMMAND   | Counter Hammer               |



Simply stay in front of Cinderella and decimate Unversed as they spawn. If
one does sneak by you will get the option to defend her with square, but you'll
have to be quick. When you make it to the Foyer use your Shotlock to take out
the Bruisers then stay alert as you progress up the steps. After the scene seek
out the four treasures around the room, a [HI-POTION], [SOOTHING CRYSTAL],
[POTION], and [STRIKE RAID] then go south back to the Palace Courtyard and grab
the chest you missed containing a [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]. Go back to the Foyer and
leave at the right to the Passage. Move through the Passage to the Antechamber
and loot the [THUNDER] in the chest. Check out the Shop if you lack a Cure
command and be sure to get one if you don't. Leave to the next area to encounter
another boss.

|  The Symphony Master shouldn't pose much of a threat as long as you've been |
| training up different abilities and leveling a little bit. If you can't seem|
| to just run in and pummel the boss then focus on taking out the instruments |
| with status inflictions and Shotlock. Use Cure as needed and if necessary a |
| D-Link to restore yourself to full health.                                  |
