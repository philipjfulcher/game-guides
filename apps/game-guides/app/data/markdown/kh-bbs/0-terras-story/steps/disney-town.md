## Becoming a Racer ##

After the opening scene is complete talk to Chip 'n' Dale to start the races.
Stick close to the walls as you race and hit the ramp on the right side for a
nice shortcut. Remember to hit square while holding X to take turns without
losing too much speed. You should be able to pull off a first place finish if
you hit the ramp every time.

After the scene you are taken back to the World Map, but go back to Disney
Town as there is a lot to do. Talk to Huey at the Ice Cream Shop to turn in
your Ice Cream ingredients. You might be able to make a few things if you've
been fighting the Prize Pods. Search for two chests in the plaza, one holds the
[DISNEY TOWN MAP] and the other a [POTION]. Smack the mailbox for a [CONFETTI]
then head west to the Raceway. Grab the two chests that are available to you
for an [ABOUNDING CRYSTAL] and [PAYBACK FANG] then you can try the next Unversed
Mission.

## Unversed Mission - Ringer Pot ##

Location: Raceway
Reward: Illusion P
1 Star: 0-19
2 Star: 20-39
3 Star: 40+

This is a pretty clean cut challenge, hit the right Ringer Pot and score
points for each Ringer Pot on the field -- hit the wrong one and gain one point
but lose 5 seconds. With High Jump this becomes much easier so you can get
up the ledges faster but this one simply takes practice. With Terra, use the
Ventus D-Link to speed him up a little bit and dash around as much as you can.

## Item Collection Resumed ##

Go down the manhole to the Gizmo Gallery. Clear the bottom floor of Unversed
and open the two chests each containing a [THUNDER]. Equip all the Thunder
element commands you have and go to the yellow box in the corner. Use Thunder
commands on it to make the bar reach the right side and put the gears in place.
Ride the first one up and jump across to a ledge with two chests containing an
[ABSOLUTE ZERO] and a [MEGA-POTION].

Ride the Mickey elevator back up to the gear and jump on the hand to another
set of gears. Wait for the Mickey face to retract then jump on the hands and
Air Glide if needed to reach the right area. Open the chests for [ACTION RECIPE]
and a [CHAOS CRYSTAL]. Go back up the original elevator and when you reach the
second set of gears go left this time and dodge the Mickey faces then jump and
Air Glide to the ledge with the chest holding a [PANACEA]. Jump down from here
towards the sticker and Air Glide in to it for the [PETE STICKER]. Get back to
that ledge and go to Pete's Rec Room.

In this room you become a pinball and your objective is to grab four chests.
You can Air Slide while being launched around so use this to reach the chests;
one in the center, one to the left of the ring of bumpers, one to the right far
above the bumpers, and the last one is way high up in the center. To open the
gate in the middle you have to hit all the blue bumpers marked with a crown.
Finding all the chests nets you a [CHAOS CRYSTAL], [ZERO GRAVIRA], [AERIAL SLAM]
and [BREAK TIME]. From the top chest exit to the Raceway and open the chest for
a [SLOT EDGE]. That's it for what you can accomplish in this area with the
exception of the mini-games. You can get some pretty decent items from them
right now, to include an upgrade in the Keyblade department, consult the mini-
games section for more details. Head over to the Olympus Coliseum when you are
ready.
