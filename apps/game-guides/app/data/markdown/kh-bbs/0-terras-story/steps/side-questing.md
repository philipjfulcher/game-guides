## Collecting Stickers ##

There are plenty of mini-games left to finish, commands and abilities left to
learn, and a bunch of stickers that have yet to be gotten. There is also the
Mirage Arena if you haven't finished it, which holds many of the best items in
the game. Start with getting the stickers that were previously unreachable by
heading to the Enchanted Dominion. Enter at the Forest Clearing and head to the
Audience Chamber and snag the [HUEY STICKER] in the middle of the room. Go to
the Castle of Dreams and enter at the Antechamber and go to the Passage to spot
the [FLYING BALLOON STICKER].

From here head to the Radiant Garden via the Entryway. Go south to the Outer
Gardens and jump up near the gate to get the [AIRPLANE STICKER]. Make your way
to the Fountain Court and leap from the highest point and Air Slide to the [DALE
STICKER] above the entrance way. Head to Disney Town via the Main Plaza and go
through Pete's Rec Room to reach the top of the Raceway. Look across the way to
spot the [TRAFFIC CONE STICKER] then proceed to Air Slide over to it.

## Playing Mini-Games ##

From here you have a number of things to choose from in terms of mini-games.
Since you are probably still in Disney Town you should start there. Winning the
Rumble Racing final race, Castle Circuit, will net you the [VICTORY LINE
KEYBLADE] if you haven't already done so. Scoring a "Fantastic" on the Master
Mode version of "Dessert Paradise" in Ice Cream Beat will net you the [FROZEN
FORTUNE COMMAND STYLE]. If you beat Captain Dark/Justice in Fruitball you will
receive the [CHAOS SNAKE SHOTLOCK]. If you go to the Olympus Coliseum and talk
to Hercules you can participate in another game where winning gives you the
[SONIC BLADE] Command.

For another keyblade you can complete all Ice Cream Shop recipes and receive
the [SWEETSTACK KEYBLADE]. It's one of the best out there, consult the
Collections section for more details on how to obtain all the necessary Ice
Cream ingredients. The Mirage Arena should be your final stop. Consult the
Mini-Games section for a full listing of items that you can receive from this
massive area. Once you feel you are all set, proceed to the Keyblade Graveyard.
