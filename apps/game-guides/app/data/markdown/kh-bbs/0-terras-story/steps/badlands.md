|  Terra immediately initiates the Dark Impulse Command Style to start the    |
| battle and will continue to unleash it through out the fight. Master Eraqus |
| takes half damage from these attacks however, they provide you speedy and   |
| stunning attacks that keep you on the offensive. When Eraqus uses some of   |
| his longer charged up attacks take the time to heal. You can block basically|
| everything that you are attacked with so take advantage of it. Remember that|
| you can't use any D-Links during this fight so keep all your healing spells |
| in the deck and keep on the offensive to win the fight.                     |

With the battle finished and the final stage set you are left with a lot of
open endings to finish if you want to fully complete the game. At this time you
may either move on to the next section and do everything aside from finish the
game or move on to the final chapter.
