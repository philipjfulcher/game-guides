## Guarding the Light ##

Defeat the Unversed as usual when you enter a new world. The Wild Bruisers
are pretty tough especially against Magnet and Zero Gravity spells, beat them
with good combos and strong spells. After the scene open the nearby chest for an
[ABOUNDING CRYSTAL] then head north. Empty the chests for the [NEVER LAND MAP]
and a [HI-POTION] and utilize the save point and shop. Go west to the Indian
Camp and bounce off the trampoline then hit the highest point on the totem pole
to make a [THUNDAGA] fall.

Head back to the Gully and go north to the Jungle Clearing. Open the chest
here for a [HI-POTION] then move to the next area. As you tackle the Unversed
take a swim to find a chest with an [ELIXIR] on an island and another with a
[DARK HAZE] in an alcove to the northeast. Leave at the southern exit and make
your way to the Rainbow Falls: Base. Grab the two treasures for a [MEGALIXIR]
and [ZERO GRAVIGA] and jump up and Air Slide to reach the [RAINBOW STICKER].

Return to the Mermaid Lagoon and go through the northern exit to the Cliff
Path. Open the chest at the bottom for a [HI-POTION] and destroy the rocks that
block your path. Defeat more Unversed and destroy the rock formations to unveil
a chest with a [FIRAGA] inside. Reach the top platform for another chest with a
[MEGA-POTION] then jump and Air Glide through the hole in the cliff. Be cautious
as you fight off the Unversed and open the chest for a [GEO IMPACT].

Return to the Cliff Path and go north to the Cove where you will find a Save
Point and two chests with an [ETHER] and [HI-POTION] inside. Continue north to
the Skull Rock: Entrance via the row boat. Run around the corner without going
north to trigger the scene, and open the chest for a [PANACEA]. Climb to the top
of the area and ignore the false chest as you enter the Skull Rock: Cavern. Open
the chest for a [MEGALIXIR] then Air Slide across to two more containing [ARS
SOLUM] and a [CHAOS CRYSTAL]. Exit here for the Prize Pods and a [CHIP STICKER]
then go back inside and jump down to initiate the scene and another boss fight.

|  Peter Pan can do some quick damage and he is rather evasive with his flight|
| but you can just sit and wait for him to come to you. Plant some Mine Square|
| or Mine Shields so that when Peter comes down to attack you he is hit,      |
| leaving himself wide open for easy combos. A D-Link with Aqua will also do  |
| the trick if you leveled her up twice since she has Mine Square then. You   |
| only need to drain half of Peter's HP to win this fight.                    |

As you leave the area you will be summoned back in, so turn around and help
out the little ones. Defeat Jellyshades until the scene triggers, one that will
help connect the story line.

When you finally regain control of Terra head back to Never Land via the Gully
entrance. Go north and then enter Peter's Hideout via the tree. Open the two
chests in the back for [MEGA MAGIC RECIPE] and a [SHIMMERING CRYSTAL], then jump
up to the [DEWEY STICKER]. Head out to the World Map and go to the Badlands.

## Unversed Mission - Element Cluster ##

Location: Indian Camp
Reward: Voltage Stack Command
1 Star: 0-39
2 Star: 40-69
3 Star: 70+

The objective here is to hit the Element Cluster with an element corresponding
to the color of the middle pillar; Yellow for Thunder, Red for Fire, and Blue
for Blizzard. Thus, the best way to do this is stock up on Thunder Surge, Fire
Surge, and use a Snow Bear to trigger the Diamond Dust Command Style to attack
the Blue (just don't trigger the Finisher so you don't have to re-apply).
