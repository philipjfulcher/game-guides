Once you make a save file after completing the Final Episode you can reload
any save with a "*", a starred completion, and go to the Keyblade Graveyard.
Here you can choose to land at the "Badlands" where you examine an orb near the
spire to trigger the battle.

| Health Points        | 200                                                  |

| Status Resistance    | Immune to all                                        |
| Elemental Weaknesses | Physical x 0.5                                       |
|                      | Fire     x 0.25                                      |
|                      | Blizzard x 0.25                                      |
|                      | Thunder  x 0.25                                      |
|                      | Dark     x 0.25                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  For starters, this battle is insanely difficult. Practically any attack    |
| that lands on you will be a one-hit kill, thus Second Chance and Once More  |
| are mandatory. Though Vanitas has very low HP he has high defense and won't |
| take much damage from magic. Don't ever use magical healing abilities, ie;  |
| Cure, Cura, Curaga. This allows Vanitas to mimic you and heal himself.      |
| Instead, equip Potions and Hi-Potions because regardless of the HP they give|
| back you'll likely end up at 1 HP remaining anyways and Vanitas can't copy  |
| this. Use the standard dodging techniques and not their offensive counters  |
| because they provide a longer period of invulnerability and you never want  |
| to block Vanitas' attacks, rather simply dodge them.                        |
|                                                                             |
|  Few attacks are effective here but Ventus' Tornado can deal some good      |
| damage. Aqua and Terra need to rely mainly on Mine Shield, Mine Square, and |
| Seeker Mine (for Aqua). Set a trap and then put it between you and Vanitas  |
| so that he falls into them and takes some damage. It will take practice to  |
| learn when you can use a potion but generally a good time is immediately    |
| after a dodge. Every now and then you can actually get in and hit Vanitas   |
| with the Keyblade but it's best to keep distance and drop Mines and dodge.  |

Save the game after beating Vanitas' Lingering Spirit and load a file where
you have access to the Land of Departure. Landing on this world will trigger an
event against the game's ultimate challenge.

| BOSS: Mysterious Figure                                                     |

|                      | Fire     x 1.0                                       |
|                      | Blizzard x 1.0                                       |
|                      | Thunder  x 1.0                                       |
|                      | Dark     x 1.0                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Like the previous secret boss the enemy will deal enough damage to leave   |
| you at 1 HP everytime. Fortunately, you can use healing spells in this fight|
| so equip them. Either equip lightning fast commands or simply load all the  |
| slots up with Curaga and rely on the Shotlock, which will be the heart of   |
| your attacks anyways. The best times to heal are after you have been knocked|
| up in the air or back away from the Mysterious Figure. You will be countered|
| basically any time you try to melee so strike from distance or with those   |
| quick commands like Sonic Blade. There isn't much to the fight but it is    |
| hard, so stick to dodging and waiting for the right time to use a Shotlock. |
