After completing the tutorial and choosing Aqua you are taken to the day she
seeks her Mark of Mastery. The task is to defeat the Orbs of Light, fast moving
balls that will emit light if left alone for too long. You can basically hack
and slash through this using your abilities as you see fit. If the Orbs of Light
ever get too far away simply use Aqua's Shotlock to close the distance and
destroy a few.
