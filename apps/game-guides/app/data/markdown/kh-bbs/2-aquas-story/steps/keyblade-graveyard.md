## The Final Battle ##

As Aqua lands turn around and empty the two chests in the back then another
on the way out for a [MEGA-POTION], [ELIXIR], and the [KEYBLADE GRAVEYARD MAP].
Don't miss the [FLOWER STICKER] near the chest on your way out to the Twister
Trench. In this area are several swirling tornadoes that will chase Aqua and
start difficult battles against Unversed. It becomes a good place to level up
and gain CP once you can handle it. There are four chests in this section, they
hold a [MEGA-ETHER], [AEROGA], [MEGALIXIR], and [MEGA-POTION]. Head to the next
area, the Fissure and grab the final sticker, a [BUBBLE STICKER] and use the
shop and save points as needed, they are the last ones in the game. Move to the
next area when you are ready for the final showdown.

## Unversed Mission - Launching Plant ##

Location: Seat of War
Reward: Illusion L
1 Star: 0-200
2 Star: 201-349
3 Star: 350+

The Launching Plant will drop orbs when hit after being launched. You'll need
to deliver a lot of hits quickly so the Spellweaver Command Style works best.
Just load up on Fabracadabra and use them twice to get the Finisher which deals
a ton of hits. Shouldn't be hard to net over 500 easily.

|  Braig warps around the battlefield firing waves of bullets from long range |
| as well as rapid bursts at close range. Aqua's Barrier can block these weak |
| but deadly attacks. Air Sliding or Cartwheeling is much more effective then |
| blocking however, defense isn't the only focus of the fight. Shotlocking is |
| the best way to get damage in on Braig since he doesn't move very fast even |
| though he teleports a lot. When you get close use large combo commands like |
| Sonic Blade or Time Splicer to really hand it to him.                       |

|  Vanitas is much tougher this go around but luckily you have Mickey helping |
| you out. Though Mickey isn't particularly useful in dealing damage, he does |
| provide Aqua time to get in large combos like Aerial Slam, Time Splicer, or |
| a Sonic Blade. Mine abilities work wonders like last time, but the Shadow   |
| Dive is also back and remains the primary threat in the fight. Shotlocks    |
| should only be executed when Vanitas is fighting with Mickey so that you    |
| don't end up getting countered or take unnecessary damage. Vanitas has a new|
| move that requires a length of charge up, be sure to break his charge with a|
| quick combo but remember to dodge once you do to avoid backlash.            |
