Jump to a chest in the corner with a [FISSION FIRAGA], a key ingredient to the
powerful Mega Flare. Next enter the Waterway and go to the Vault. Activate the
bubble furnace with a fire technique and Doubleflight from up top to an easy
[BUBBLE STICKER]. Head to the Dungeon Cell at the Enchanted Dominion and enter
the Dungeon where you can spot the [HORACE STICKER] and easily reach with a
Doubleflight. Lastly, enter Disney Town's Main Plaza and Doubleflight to reach
the [MINNIE STICKER] near the central fixture.
