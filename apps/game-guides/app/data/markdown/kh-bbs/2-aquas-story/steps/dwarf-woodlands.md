After the opening scene loot the [POISON] and [PAYBACK SURGE] from the chests
then enter the Cottage and grab an [ATTACK RECIPE] from another chest. Go south
from here in to the Deep Woods where you'll find three more chests holding a
[POTION], [ETHER], and [HI-POTION]. Move on to the Flower Glade where you'll
find a chest with a [HUNGRY CRYSTAL] and the world's Prize Pods. In the next
area, the Courtyard, you will find four more chests. You can get the [DWARF
WOODLANDS MAP], [PICNIC BASKET STICKER], [FLEETING CRYSTAL], and [POTION] but
not the [FISSION FIRAGA] at this time.

Enter the Underground Waterway where you will find gated off areas. To open
them you must hit the wheels and dash through to reach the prizes. Equip a dash
command like Sliding Dash and hit the first wheel. Dash through the gate and
fight off Unversed, loot the chest for a [SHIMMERING CRYSTAL]. Hit the next
switch and jump down through the gate. You can grab the chest here for a
[FLEETING CRYSTAL] and then make another run to the far chest that holds a
[FIRE].

Once you have everything move to the Vault. Use the Fire command to light the
furnace in the corner to reach the chests in this area. Loot them all for a
[BALLOON LETTER], [POTION], [MAGNET], and [SHIMMERING CRYSTAL]. The [BUBBLE
STICKER] is currently out of reach so head to the Magic Mirror Chamber next.

|  The Spirit of the Magic Mirror is a fairly easy boss. It's primary form    |
| of damage comes from it's illusions where it will use several attacks. The  |
| Fireball attack is easy to guard with Barrier, but the White Fireball will  |
| need to be dodged because it will also cause Confusion. The two primary     |
| illusions are the Reflection and Sidestep. Reflection has the Magic Mirror  |
| form several copies in a circle around Aqua, the real Magic Mirror has a    |
| wry smile as opposed to the menacing glare. This move can also be used in a |
| line of copies where you'll need to maneuver down the path dodging Fireball |
| attacks along the way. Sidestep is a quick attack where the Magic Mirror    |
| moves side to side leaving a reflection.                                    |
|                                                                             |
|  Dash attacks are useful in this fight so you can quickly close the gap and |
| ranged magic helps as well. During Reflection just avoid taking damage      |
| because when the real Magic Mirror reveals itself you'll be able to go on   |
| the offensive.                                                              |

After the scene you are taken back to the World Map, venture to the Enchanted
Dominion.

## Unversed Mission - Survival Bottle ##

Location: Underground Waterway
Reward: Illusion S
1 Star: 0'00"00 - 0'59"59
2 Star: 1'00"00 - 1'59"59
3 Star: 2'00"00+

The trick here is to load up on a bunch of Cure commands and have a long
Shotlock like Meteor Shower or Ragnarok so you can reach the Survival Bottle.
The poison will kill you quickly so chase down the Survival Bottle and use
Finishers often since you are immune during them (same with Shotlocks). Use a
Cure when you can't reach the Survival Bottle in time and dash to keep up. Just
watch out when the Survival Bottle dashes at you, Guard then counter!
