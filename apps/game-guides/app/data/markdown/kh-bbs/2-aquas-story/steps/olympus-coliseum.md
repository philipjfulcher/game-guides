## Dealing with the Lord of the Underworld ##

As you land you are tackled by Unversed, a few new ones with some tricks up
there sleeves. Buckle Bruisers can't be hit from the front, simply hit them
with strong magic or from behind. Collect the [FIREWORKS STICKER], [MEGA-POTION]
[CURA], and [FIRE STRIKE] from the chests. The southern area has the Prize Pods,
but the northern area, the Vestibule, holds the [OLYMPUS COLISEUM MAP] as well

magic and a few Magnet spells to make it easier.

With the qualifiers over, Aqua can compete in the finals. Change your deck to
your standard fighting style, just keep in mind that Zack is highly vulnerable
to status effects.

|  Equip Ignite and Poison, these are great for damaging Zack overtime. You   |
| need to use Aqua's magical prowess to win this fight -- Shotlock and        |
| Command Styles are the way to go. Zack starts the battle by using a Jump    |
| Slash attack that can be avoided with Carthweel. Triple Blizzaga and Mine   |
| Square are great to trip up Zack and allow a Keyblade Combo. Zack doesn't   |
| have many attacks without being controlled by Hades anymore. You can guard  |
| against the triple slash combo and the Lightning Slash, they are pretty     |
| easy to read because Zack telegraphs his attacks. Attack after guarding and |
| you shouldn't have any trouble.                                             |

After the battle you can change your deck and save again. It's a good idea to
bring a mix of fire and blizzard attacks for the fight. Speak to Phil to start
the next match.

| BOSS: Hades and Ice Colossus                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Health Points        | 450 (Hades) 400 (Ice Colossus)                       |
| Strength             | 16                                                   |

| Status Resistance    | Immune to all but Ignite (Ice Colossus)              |
|                      | Immune to all but Freeze (Hades)                     |
| Elemental Weaknesses | Physical x 1.0                                       |
|                      | Fire     x 0.5 (x 1.25 for Ice Colossus)             |
|                      | Blizzard x 0.5                                       |
|                      | Thunder  x 0.75                                      |
|                      | Dark     x 0.75                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Hades won't attack you unless you provoke him so focus on the Ice          |
| Colossus. It takes additional damage from Fire so use Fire Strike and       |
| Triple Firaga to deal quick damage to it. The Ice Colossus will use Iceball |
| to fire several quick balls that should be dodged. As you turn behind the   |
| Ice Colossus it will turn with you very slowly, stomping and creating       |
| shockwaves that you'll need to jump over. Lastly, the Ice Colossus will use |
| a Groundpound with his fist that can also create a shockwave. It's not too  |
| hard to deal a lot of damage using Fire so stick to that.                   |
|                                                                             |
|  Hades joins the fray once the Ice Colossus goes down and he only uses      |
| three attacks as well. A standard melee attack is easy to dodge or block,   |
| but the Fireball should be reflected with Barrier to damage Hades. The last |
| attack that Hades uses is Flamethrower, where he turns red and spins in     |
| circles shooting fire from his hands. It's easy to back away or turn in     |
| tight circles with Hades. He can be interrupted with damage so just use the |
| Keyblade to get in all the damage you need on him.                          |

After the battle you can always return to duel Hercules in Break the Urns to
win a [SONIC BLADE] command. Head to the Deep Space when you are finished here.

## Unversed Mission - Shade Jelly ##

Location: Town Near Thebes
Reward: Stopga
1 Star: 1'00"00+
2 Star: 0'31"00 - 0'59"00
3 Star: 0'00"01 - 0'30"59

The trick here is to defeat all 300 Shade Jelly using clearing commands like
Magnega and Meteor, Mega Flare, Thundaga, etc... There really isn't much else to
it, just stack some heavy commands and go to town.
