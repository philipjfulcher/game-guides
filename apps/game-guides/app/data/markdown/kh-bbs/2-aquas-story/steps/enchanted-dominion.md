## In the Dungeon ##

After you arrive turn around and grab the [HI-POTION] from the chest. Head to
the top of the ramp in to the Gates. You can obtain a [SLEEP] and [CURE] from
two chests but the others will have to wait. Move on to Maleficent's Throne
where Aqua finds Ventus and is unfortunately dumped in to a cell. Open the
nearby chest for the [ENCHANTED DOMINION MAP] then move on to the Dungeon.
Make your way to the Hall where you fight alongside Prince Philip. Leave at the
southern end to reach the top portion of the Dungeon.

Loot the [HI-POTION] from the chest and use a dash command to cross the large
gap and get the [ICE BARRAGE] from a chest. Return to the Hall and leave at the
western end to reach Maleficent's Throne. There is a [CONFUSION STRIKE] in the
chest at the top of the throne, grab it and move on to the Gates. The objective
is to defeat enough enemies so that Philip moves to a corner and calls for Aqua
to break the wall and allow her to jump up. Once up top take out the remaining
enemies and open the chest for a [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]. Hit the wheel in the
corner to open the gate.

In the southern end do the same thing, defeat all the enemies and break the
wall to reach the second layer. There are two chests up top with an [ABSOLUTE
ZERO] and [PULSING CRYSTAL], hit the wheel to raise the gate.

| COMMAND        | High Jump                    |


Equip High Jump immediately and head south to the Waterside. There are three
chests in this area with an [ETHER], [BALLOON LETTER], and a [POTION]. You can
also find the Prize Pods in this area. Move to the Forest Clearing for the last
chest containing a [HI-POTION] and a [FLOWER STICKER] that can be reached via
High Jump. Equip a few good healing abilities and move to the next area for a
boss fight.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  You'll want to be fighting the Dragon off to the side since it can only    |
| strike head on or with a Ground Stomp. Use Thunder, Blizzard, and Fire to   |
| deal damage from the side. If you need to back away from avoid the Ground   |
| Stomp then get back in close with Barrier Surge. Mine Square is also a good |
| Command to use if you can get head on to drop it. To avoid the biting combo |
| use Barrier or Cartwheel out of the way. When the Dragon uses Flamebreath   |
| you need to move over to Prince Phillip and use square to trigger the       |
| "Selfless Prince" command and banish the flames.                            |
|                                                                             |
|  The first phase last until 50% HP and then the Dragon begins to fly. Use   |
| this time to get hits in with your Shotlock and heal up. When you deal      |
| enough damage Prince Phillip will once again give you access to the         |
| "Selfless Prince" command so you can ride the Dragon's back. Get into the   |
| Spellweaver Command Style and unleash some magic to end the battle at this  |
| point and take down Maleficent.                                             |

## Unversed Mission - Flaming Box ##

Location: Waterside

Start the challenge where a Flaming Box launches fireballs into the sky. You
must break them before they hit the ground. This is best done with simple
Keyblade strikes on single targets and Magnet/Zero Gravity on larger groups.
The longer you go the more fireballs will get launched simultaneously.
