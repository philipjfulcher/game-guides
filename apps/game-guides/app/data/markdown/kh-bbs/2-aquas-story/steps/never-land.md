## The Power of Flight ##

Aqua starts off in the Indian Camp, use the trampoline and smack the high
point on the totem pole for a [THUNDAGA]. It's not easy to do, try using the
Aerial Slam command to reach the top pole. Move to the Gully and grab the
[NEVER LAND MAP] as well as a [MEGA-POTION] from the chests. From here head
north to the Jungle Clearing where you'll find a [HI-POTION] in a chest and
a [FIREWORKS STICKER] high above in the tree. You can reach the sticker with a
well timed Keyblade Swing and a High Jump.

Enter Peter's Hideout via the hole in the tree and open the two chests in the
back for a [MINE SHIELD] and an [ELIXIR]. Head back out and go northeast to the
Mermaid Lagoon where you'll find a [RAINBOW STICKER] and two chests with an
[ELIXIR] and the powerful [FIRAGA BURST]. After you grab the treasures exit at
the southwest to the Seacoast. As you pass through this area grab the [ETHER]
and [HI-POTION]. In the Rainbow Falls: Base you'll find two more chests with a
[PANACEA] and a [FLEETING CRYSTAL].

Jump on the golden glowing balls to propel Aqua higher up and in to the next
area, Rainbow Falls: Ascent. In this area are four chests and the [CHIP STICKER]
so start off by going right at the split and up to two chests, a [FIRAGA] and
the grand [TIME SPLICER]. Drop down to the lower level here and grab the sticker
then open the chests for a [THUNDAGA] and [CHAOS CRYSTAL]. Use the magic golden
balls to reach the top and enter Rainbow Falls: Crest. Open the chest as you
enter for a [MEGA-ETHER] and then continue till you reach the Gully.

|  Vanitas can be fought much the same way he was fought the first time. Be   |
| sure to dodge his attacks and don't be tricked when he leaves a mirror image|
| behind. Shotlock from a distance to get his health low, but when Vanitas    |
| reaches 50% HP he will begin to use a deadly attack. This attack cannot be  |
| blocked; Vanitas tunnels underground and erupts beneath Aqua for heavy      |
| damage. Use Aqua's Cartwheel to become invulnerable for a short period of   |
| time and negate the damage here. Basically, run for your life and Cartwheel |
| whenever you see the black and red sphere under you. This fight can be easy |
| though if you can immobilize Vanitas and be smart with commands. Mine Square|
| or Mine Shield work wonders as well as your new Time Splicer command. Use a |
| Shotlock only when you have distance and time.                              |

After a series of scenes head to the Mysterious Tower.

## Unversed Mission - Element Cluster ##

Location: Indian Camp
Reward: Voltage Stack Command
1 Star: 0-39
2 Star: 40-69
3 Star: 70+

The objective here is to hit the Element Cluster with an element corresponding
to the color of the middle pillar; Yellow for Thunder, Red for Fire, and Blue
for Blizzard. Thus, the best way to do this is stock up on Thunder Surge, Fire
Surge, and use a Snow Bear to trigger the Diamond Dust Command Style to attack
the Blue (just don't trigger the Finisher so you don't have to re-apply).
