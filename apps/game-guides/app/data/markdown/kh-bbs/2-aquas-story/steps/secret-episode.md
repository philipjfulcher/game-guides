## The Realm of Darkness ##

Save then move up to the darkness spot. Defeat the Heartless, Shadows and
Neo Shadows, then continue to find some Darkballs. Leap upon the ball of dark
energy to launch upwards to a new level. Clear the darkness spot and loot the
chest for a [BALLOON LETTER]. Launch higher then drop into the Lower Zone where
you'll find a chest with a [CHAOS CRYSTAL]. Clear more darkness spots and drop
down to a mysterious looking one. Defeat the Heartless here to spawn a ball of
dark energy to launch higher and pillar.

Drop down for now and clear a darkness spot so you can nab the [BLACKOUT].
Leave at this exit to return to the Middle Zone where you can grab the [ZERo
GRAVIGA] and clear another darkness spot. Return to the area where you just
raised a pillar. Climb up and onto that pillar, launching higher onto another
platform. There are two darkness spots here, clear them to create a new way up.
Towards the top is a chest with a [SECRET GEM]. Head into the next area, the
Upper Zone, where you need to clear zones of darkness. Start clearing around the
left and you'll spot a chest with a [MEGALIXIR].

Check the platform on the far right for a [TRIPLE FIRAGA] then drop down. In
this center area you'll find the final chest, [TRANSCENDENCE] is within. Head
back up and enter the main sphere of darkness once you've cleared all the other
minor locations. You'll have to clear a large number of Shadow and Neo Shadow
Heartless in here, but you'll get a nice reward when you are done, a Save Point.
Head into the next area for the boss, an Unknown Heartless.
