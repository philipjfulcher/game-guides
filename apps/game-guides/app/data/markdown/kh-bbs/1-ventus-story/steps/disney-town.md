## Ice Cream Beat ##

After the opening scene you have many things you can do in Disney Town. Only
one of them, Ice Cream Beat, is mandatory to completing the world. Since it's
the mandatory one start with it and get it out of the way. If you need help
consult the mini-game section. Open the two chests in the Main Plaza for the
[DISNEY TOWN MAP] and a [POTION]. Head down the manhole to enter the Gizmo
Gallery where there are two chests with [THUNDER] inside. At the back end use
Thunder-based attacks on the meter to start the gears. Ride the mickey elevator
up and jump over to the ledge to find a chest containing a [MEGA-POTION].

Jump to the gears and make it up to the second set. Go right past the panel
and on to the four hands, use a dash command if needed and reach the northern
platform. Grab the [MEGA-POTION] and [CHAOS CRYSTAL] from the chests then make
your way back to the four hands. When you reach the third hand jump off to the
right against the wall and swing the Keyblade to reach the [MICKEY STICKER].
Return again to the first set of gears but this time make your way left and
across to another chest with a [MEGA-ETHER] and the entrance to Pete's Rec Room.

## Ven the Pinball ##

In this room you get to play pinball and Ventus is the ball. Utilize the
flippers with L and R and use dash commands to alter Ventus' location so you
can bounce him off the correct bumpers to reach all five chests; two in the
alcove on the machine's left side, another chest and sticker in the right side
alcove, and one in each of the center alcoves. The bars block the alcove until
you hit the four blue bumpers marked with a crown. In the end you should have
an [ACTION RECIPE], [PANACEA], [AERIAL SLAM], [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL], [BREAK TIME]
and the [MINNIE STICKER].

Once you've collected all the treasures head out to the Racetrack's rooftop.
Grab the [SLOT EDGE] from the chest and equip at least two dash commands. If you
can't do this then don't worry you can come back, but you can get [SUPERGLIDE]
right now by using both dash commands in succession and jumping off the boxes
aiming towards the distant rooftop. From here you can look back at the rooftop
you just left to spot the [CHIP STICKER]. Now you can drop down and grab the
remaining chests for [REVERSAL SLASH], [STOP], and a [SHIMMERING CRYSTAL]. Take
this time to complete any mini-games you choose. You can obtain the [FROZEN
FORTUNE COMMAND STYLE], the [CHAOS SNAKE SHOTLOCK], and the [VICTORY LINE
KEYBLADE] from them. Head to the Olympus Coliseum when you are all wrapped up.

## Unversed Mission - Ringer Pot ##

Location: Raceway
Reward: Illusion P
1 Star: 0-19
2 Star: 20-39
3 Star: 40+

This is a pretty clean cut challenge, hit the right Ringer Pot and score
points for each Ringer Pot on the field -- hit the wrong one and gain one point
but lose 5 seconds. With High Jump this becomes much easier so you can get
up the ledges faster but this one simply takes practice.
