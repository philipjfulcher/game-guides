Before Ventus even makes it to the world he is attacked by a large Unversed.
Fortunately, after just a few hits it will disappear and you are taken to the
world.

After the scene turn around and enter the Durgon Transporter. Loot the chest
for an [ABOUNDING CRYSTAL] and clear out the Unversed to spawn the Prize Pods
in the back. Head back to the Ship Corridor and grab the [HI-POTION] and a
[PULSING CRYSTAL] from the chests. Proceed to trip the security alarm where
Ventus must destroy wave after wave of Unversed as he progresses to each new
sector. In the second area are two chests containing a [MEGA-ETHER] and a [HI-
POTION]. Enter the Control Room where a save point and shop are located, as well
as the [DEEP SPACE MAP] which resides in the chest.

Continue into the Ship Hub where you should immediately drop down. Snag the
[ZERO GRAVITY] from the chest and use the control panel to lower gravity. Now
you can jump up to higher levels, so open the chest higher up for a [THUNDARA]
and fly across the top floor to snag the [UFO STICKER]. Turn gravity back on
to reach the [PULSE BOMB] chest then turn it back off to jump to the next area,
the Launch Deck. Dodge the lasers and open the chest for the [MEGA ATTACK
RECIPE] then glide to the other end for another chest with [XEHANORT'S REPORT 1]
inside.

Drop down to the ground floor and open two chests for a [FIRE SURGE] and a
[FLEETING CRYSTAL]. Turn the gravity off and jump back to the top and grab the
[ICE CREAM STICKER] then turn it on and exit at the east. Open the chest for a
[MEGA-POTION] and use the save point for the upcoming boss.

|  The Metamorphosis you fought in space has returned. Stitch aka Experiment  |
| 626, is here to fight alongside. Whenever the boss feeds on the glowing     |
| white pillar it causes damage to the ship. While it's doing this go all out |
| with your most damaging attacks or Shotlock. If the boss is ever too high to|
| reach use the control panel to turn off gravity so you can hit it.          |

Return to Deep Space and land in the Machinery Bay Access. Re-enter the room
where you just fought the Metamorphosis and turn off the gravity. Now you can
leap up and reach the last two chests containing a [CHAOS CRYSTAL] and a [MINE
SHIELD]. Head to Never Land once you are done.

## Unversed Mission - Jelly Glee Tea ##

Location: Launch Deck
Reward: Stun Block / Stop Barrier
1 Star: 0-50 Orbs
2 Star: 51-89 Orbs
3 Star: 90-100 Orbs

The trick to collecting enough orbs is to Counter the Jelly Glee Tea and
use powerful commands like Meteor Crash and Chaos Blade. This challenge is much
like the Struggle battles in Kingdom Hearts 2, so you must collect the orbs as
you knock them loose. Once you collect 90+ just run around until time expires.
