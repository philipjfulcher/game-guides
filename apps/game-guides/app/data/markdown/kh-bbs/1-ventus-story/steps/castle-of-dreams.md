After the opening scene is done grab the [POTION] from the chest. Defeat the
Unversed and make your way to the top of the area and Cinderella's Room. After
another scene you are tasked with finding parts for Cinderella's dress. Hop up
on the yarn ball when necessary to reach the three chests holding [CASTLE OF
DREAMS MAP], [MAGIC RECIPE], and [STUN EDGE]. On top of the vanity is the
[FIREWORKS STICKER].

Head back through the Mousehole and into the Wardrobe Room. Here you will find
all five pieces that you need but at the moment only three are available. The
[PINK FABRIC] is on the ground level, the [WHITE LACE] is on the sofa, and the
[WHITE SASH] is on a tall stack of books only reachable with the yarn ball. With
the use of the yarn ball you can get three chests which contain a [FLEETING
CRYSTAL], [BALLOON LETTER], and [BLIZZARD]. Enter the Mousehole via the bottom
entrance at the north.

Grab the [POTION] from the chest on your way up to a fork. Use the fork to
propel higher up and on to the other side of the wall. At the bottom a chest
with an [ETHER] awaits. Equip a dash command like Slide Dash and stand on the
forks tip then use the command. Make sure not to overshoot and loot the chest
for the [THUNDERSTORM SHOTLOCK] then use the command to get back. Exit to the
Wardrobe Room and cross the ruler to the [PINK THREAD]. Jump over the books to
reach a chest with a [ZERO GRAVITY].

Jump down and return to the first fork in the Mousehole. Jump and cross the
gap at the southern end. Smack the matchbox through the hole and use it to reach
the spiderweb on the otherside. Smack it to release the cheese then spot the
[LOUIE STICKER], fall towards it and swing your Keyblade to snag it. Jump on the
cheese to reach a chest with a [PULSING CRYSTAL]. Go back against the wall and
check behind the book for a chest with a [HUNGRY CRYSTAL]. Exit back in to the
Wardrobe Room via the new hole and snag the [WHITE BUTTON] to find out that you
still need a pearl. Head to the Wardrobe Room for the final time to face
Lucifer.

|  Lucifer isn't that difficult and is much easier than the first boss. Your  |
| Shotlock will do some damage off the start especially if you went and got   |
| Ragnarok. The easiest way to get damage on Lucifer is to dodge his pounces  |
| with a roll and smack him in the head to start a chain of button commands   |
| that allow you to ride Lucifer like a bull and do significant damage. Take  |
| your time and make sure you hit the right button because it can take up to  |
| a third of Lucifer's health if done correctly.                              |
