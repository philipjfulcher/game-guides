## Follow Mickey ##

As you arrive in the Radiant Garden Ventus will notice Mickey heading to
another area. Grab the [POTION] and [ETHER] from the chests in the Central
Square then follow Mickey nortwest to the Gardens where you will have to climb
three levels to reach the Front Doors. Don't forget the four chests with a
[HI-POTION], [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL], [BINDING STRIKE], and [SLOW]. The [ICE CREAM
STICKER] is at the dead-end set of stairs on the second tier.

Beware the new Unversed, especially the Mandrakes as they can fire spinning
green sickles across the map dealing damage to you before you can see them. Tank
Toppers are your worst enemy, they function like bombs in that one hit sets them
off unless you hit their valve in the back. You can always immobilize them
before they can change and explode if you can't deal enough damage fast enough
or hate striking from behind.

## Chasing the Trinity Armor ##

At the Front Doors you will find two chests with a [HI-POTION] and a [FREEZE
RAID]. Ventus is turned away during the cut scene at the top of the stairs but
if you have High Jump rank 2 you can reach the [FIREWORKS STICKER] with the
extra reach of your Keyblade. Return to the Central Square to meet with Scrooge
McDuck and receive three [DISNEY TOWN PASSES]. From here go east to the Castle
Town area and grab the [RADIANT GARDEN MAP] from the nearby chest. Head in to
Merlin's House and open the chest for the [BLOCK RECIPE] and examine the book,
"Winnie the Pooh", to unlock the Command Board for it.

Take the north exit to the Fountain Court where the objective is to reach the
top platform. Drop down to the bottom level and check the corner near the steps
for some Unversed, clearing them will reveal the Prize Pods in this world. Ride
the waterspouts to the middle platform and meet a new Unversed, the Chrono
Twister. These Unversed will cast deadly spells when their timer runs out on the
hourglass. To reach the [HUEY STICKER] and [COUNTER RUSH] in the northeast chest
you have to drop down to the right side of the middle platform and ride the
waterspout up. The chest can be opened by jumping to the other platform, to get
the sticker you must jump out and swing the Keyblade frantically.

Exit at the west to reach the Aqueduct where you will find more Mandrakes and
three more chests containing a [PANACEA], [FIRE], and [HI-POTION]. Equip Ventus
for the boss fight at the end of the Aqueduct and proceed to the Reactor.

|  Terra and Aqua make an appearance here but don't help out too much in      |
| combat. Focus on taking out the legs first with high level commands or the  |
| Shotlock. Move on to the arms only after the legs have been dealt with and  |
| watch out for the sweeping energy beams. You can dash through them to get   |
| behind the boss and deal some good close range damage. Trinity Armor will   |
| separate itself after the first wave of energy beams, be sure to keep your  |
| distance so that you can dodge the barrage of attacks. Once the limbs are   |
| gone pummel the body to end the fight.                                      |

## Unversed Mission - Diet Tank ##

Location: Outer Gardens
Reward: Illusion D
1 Star: 2'00"00+
2 Star: 1'00"00 - 1'59"59
3 Star: 0'00"00 - 0'59"59

The objective is to shrink the Diet Tank by hitting the valve on the back.
Load up with Thunder Surge commands then start the challenge. The Diet Tank will
shoot up into the air, just lock on and Guard but don't use a counter. Instead
use a Thunder Surge to deal massive damage and force the Diet Tank back into
the air. Chase it down and keep using a Guard -> Thunder Surge combo to win.
