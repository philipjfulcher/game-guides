## Defeat Vanitas ##

Loot the four chests for a [MEGA-POTION], [ELIXIR], [XEHANORT'S REPORT 12],
and the [KEYBLADE GRAVEYARD MAP]. The [ICE CREAM STICKER] can be reached with
a simple High Jump. Head to the Twister Trench where spinning tornadoes will
chase after Ventus and start a tough battle. Beware the Mandrake's in these
battles or you could wind up feeling their wrath. There are five chests in total
in the Twister Trench; a [MEGA-ETHER], [MEGA-POTION], [ELIXIR], [WIND RAID],
and [MEGALIXIR] strewn across the plain. The final sticker, an [ICE CREAM
STICKER] is found on the northern wall. Enter the Fissure and use the save and
shop if you need. This is your last chance to save before the finale.

|  Ventus faces Vanitas alone in the final battle's first round. Vanitas will |
| use most of the same tricks as in the first fight, but he has a few new ones|
| as well. One involves riding a wave of Keyblades around the battlefield     |
| shooting beams at you. You can dodge with Superglide but it's best to use a |
| Shotlock here for damage. A simple Mine command will help stop Vanitas in   |
| his tracks with this attack.                                                |

|  Vanitas typically uses a Shotlock style attack at the start of this fight. |
| Respond with your own Shotlock immediately to become invulnerable and deal  |
| damage. Most of Vanitas' new moves are completely unblockable and it will   |
| become difficult to track what's going on amidst the chaos. Dodging is a low|
| priority, utilize your own attacks to counter his instead and use Shotlocks |
| when you have a large enough opening. Faith and Salvation will be lifesavers|
| if you have them. When Vanitas gets low enough on health the screen will    |
| explode and Ventus becomes a Dimension Link. You basically are made to do a |
| series of button combinations in order to fend Vanitas off. The ultimate    |
| goal is to charge your Command Gauge and use the Last Word finish command,  |
| it's the only way you can win the fight.                                    |
