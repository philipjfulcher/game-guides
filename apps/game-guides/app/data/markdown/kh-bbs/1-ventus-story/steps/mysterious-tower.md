Scope the area for the treasure chests to find a [CHAOS CRYSTAL], [MAGNEGA],
and [WELLSPRING CRYSTAL]. The [ICE CREAM STICKER] is really easy to reach as
well. Enter the tower once you are done and grab the [MEGA MAGIC RECIPE] from
the chest. Climb the steps for a scene with Master Yen Sid. Head to the Badlands
when it's all done to trigger another scene.
