## Pit Stop for Ventus ##

The first place you want to go is Never Land and grab the two chests in the
Cove that you couldn't earlier, the [MEGALIXIR] and [MEGA-POTION]. The other
spot you want to complete is the Enchanted Dominion. Head to the Audience
Chamber and glide from the steps to the [DEWEY STICKER]. There is also the
Mirage Arena and any commands or abilities you haven't found. Complete the game
as much as you want before heading to the Keyblade Graveyard and the finale of
Ventus' Story.
