## Hook and the Lost Boys ##

As you enter Never Land you are greeted by Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys.
Turn around and enter the Rainbow Falls: Base to find a chest with a [MEGALIXIR]
and the [RAINBOW STICKER]. Back at the Seacoast you'll find two more chests
holding a [PANACEA] and a [HI-POTION]. Move onward to the Mermaid Lagoon where
you can check the eastern shore for two chests with [AEROGA] and an [ELIXIR]
as well as the [DALE STICKER]. Make your way to the western exit for another
scene. Afterwards, loot the chest for a [BALLOON LETTER] and check the tree to
enter Peter's Hideout.

Snag the [MEGA-ETHER] and [FLEETING CRYSTAL] and use the shop and save point
as needed, especially if you don't have Stun Block yet. Head south to the Gully
where you'll find two more chests, one with an [ABOUNDING CRYSTAL], another with
the [NEVER LAND MAP]. Proceed to the Indian Camp for a scene and an ambush by
the Unversed. You can return to this area afterwards and attack the totem pole
top for a Thundaga. Head to Mermaid Lagoon for yet another scene and afterwards
head to the Cliff Path.

| COMMAND        | Glide                        |



Glide isn't all that useful if you already obtained Superglide. Grab the
[HI-POTION] from the chest down below and break through the rocks to the next
portion of the area. Destroy the boulders to reveal the [TREASURE RAID] chest
and climb to the top to find a [FIRAGA] in another chest. Jump through to the
Mermaid Lagoon again to find yourself on top. There is a [BLITZ] in the chest
and you should spawn the Prize Pods here. Head to the Cove where you have a
chance to save before the boss fight and grab the [ETHER] in the chest next to
it.

|  Captain Hook is too skilled to attack head on, he'll block all of your     |
| swings. Luckily enough you can do the same and having Stun Block equipped   |
| will leave him wide open once you do. Hook will throw exploding presents so |
| be sure to dodge them. Captain Hook is extremely vulnerable to status       |
| effects so utilize all that you have. You also need to avoid the crocodile  |
| in the water as it will do damage to Ventus and cannot be destroyed. If you |
| can hit Hook on the side and knock him in to the water the crocodile will   |
| nip away some HP and leave Hook vulnerable once he resurfaces.              |
