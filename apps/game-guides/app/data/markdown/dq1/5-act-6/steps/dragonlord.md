title: DRAGONLORD

Talk to the Dragonlord. He will give you an opportunity to rule the world
alongside him. The catch is that he will get the Living half while you get the
Dead half. Clever Dragonlord. Anyway, if you accept his proposal twice, you will
be returned to the Inn at Rimuldar. So decline his offer twice and prepare for
the final battle!

| DRAGONLORD - 225 HP - 40 MP - Can cast Snooze, Midheal and Sizzle            |

| During this battle, be sure to keep your HP above 95 in case of Snooze. Keep |
| attacking him physically. Even though he has Midheal, he will eventually be  |
| taken down.                                                                  |

| DRAGONLORD (TRUE FORM) - 300 HP                                              |
|                                                                              |

| This Boss is the real deal. He can spit out a fiery torrent of flames and    |
| breathe fire, both of which do minimal damage. His physical attacks do       |
| medium damage. Also, he can belch out blistering flames, doing a maximum     |
| damage of 50+, and that's with Erdrick's Armour equipped. Back to back       |
| belches could be really bad. If you are only at level 20, it may take several|
| tries until you get lucky enough to kill him. Use Midheal every time you dip |
| below 95 HP. He should go down after only a few tries.                       |
|                                                                              |
| Victory!                                                                     |
