Head over to the Vault, deposit your Faerie Flute and Princess's Pledge.
Withdraw the Sunstone and the Staff of Rain. Also, make sure you have the Mark
of Erdrick. Now you need to walk to the Holy Sanctum south of Rimuldar. Cast
Holy Protection the whole way to avoid all the monster encounters.

Head inside and go downstairs to find a priest. Talk to him in order to give him
the Sunstone and the Staff of Rain. He will offer them to the Almighty Goddess.
A chest will appear; open it to receive the RAINBOW DROP. Leave the Sanctum.

Northwest of the Sanctum and west of Rimuldar is a narrow peninsula. Go to the
very tip of the peninsula and use the Rainbow Drop to make a bridge appear. Now
you have access to the Dragonlord's Castle. Return to Rimuldar if you need to
rest at the Inn or stock up on Medicinal Herbs and Magic Keys. Otherwise,
continue to the Dragonlord's Castle.
