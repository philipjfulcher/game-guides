title: MARK OF ERDRICK
order: 0

Once you get to level 17, go back to Cantlin. Notice the building in the centre
of the town. If you go inside the building (just walk into the side of it) and
exit south, you will see two doors followed by a pathway lined with damage
tiles. Before you had Erdrick's Armour, each tile would deal 15 damage to you.
But because you have the armour equipped, the tiles now do no damage at all.

Unlock one of the doors and walk harmlessly over to a person who will tell you
where to search for the last artefact. Tantegel is 70 steps north and 40 steps
west of the artefact.

If you have it, go outside and use the Princess's Pledge. The coordinates the
man gave in Cantlin are Tantegel's coordinates relative to the artefact. Match
them up with your location and you find the artefact.

Go north from Cantlin, cross the bridge and head southwest. Cross the next
bridge you see and head southeast to a huge poisonous swamp. Go to the east side
of the swamp and keep using Princess's Pledge to find the MARK OF ERDRICK. A "!"
will appear above the Hero's head once he's found the right spot. That's three
out of three. Zoom back to Tantegel, rest up at the Inn and save with the King.
