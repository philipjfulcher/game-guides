title: LEGENDARY SWORD
order: 2
---




On this floor and the next floor down, you will be fighting the same monsters
you saw at Damdara, including Knight Aberrants.

From the entrance, head west and follow the path to the Throne room that is
between two other rooms with staircases that lead nowhere. Search the sparkle
behind the Throne to find a hidden stairway leading to the next level.



**Floor B1**



Use a Magic Key on the door and follow the linear path west, south, then east.
Take the northeast path to the stairs.



**Floor B2**



On this floor you can fight Blue Dragons, who attack and breathe fire. I
recommend using the Snooze-Flee tactic on the Stone Golems instead of fighting
them. From the stairs, head west and follow the path. Take the north path at the
intersection. When you come to two paths heading south, take the western path
south to some stairs.



**Floor B3**



Northwest of the stairs are two chests containing 502G and a MEDICINAL HERB. Go
east past the stairs you just came from, also passing the stairs in the
northeast corner and head west and down the next stairs you see.



**Floor B4**



Walk directly south and you should see two staircases, one ascending and one
descending. The descending stairs leads to a room that loops endlessly. Take the
ascending stairs.



**Floor B3**



Go southeast to the stairs and take them up to the next floor.



**Floor B2**



Take the stairs right next to you.



**Floor B1**



Finally, head north and open the chest to find the best weapon in the game,
ERDRICK'S SWORD.

| Note: The defense boost the Dragon Scale provides is negligible at this point|
| in the game. If you prefer item space, you can get rid of both accessories   |
| now.                                                                         |
