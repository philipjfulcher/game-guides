title: FINAL GRIND
order: 3
---




The only thing left to do in the game is to meet up with the final two monsters
you haven't seen yet and beat the Dragonlord. It may be possible to beat him at
level 17, but it will be very difficult to do. Level 20 is a more normal level
to take on the Dragonlord with. I like grinding south of Damdara where the Metal
Slimes are.

At Level 19 you learn the final spell, Sizzle. It can deal 50-65 damage to
monsters. It's pretty much useless. Many of the tougher monsters have a
resistance to Sizzle. Your MP is better spent using Midheal.
