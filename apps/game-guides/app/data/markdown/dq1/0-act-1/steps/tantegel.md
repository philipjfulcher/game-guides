title: TANTEGEL
order: 1

You will start with a talk between the Hero and the King. Your mission is to
retrieve the Sphere of Light from the Dragonlord and restore light to the dark
land of Alefgard... once more? Apparently this is not the first time Alefgard
has been the land of darkness.

It looks as if the Hero has a big nose. And the plume on the helmet looks like
the Tanooki Tail from Super Mario 3. Mario! Is that you? You are in the wrong
game!

Anyway, once you have control of the Hero, open the chests for 120G, a TORCH and
a MAGIC KEY. Use the Magic Key to unlock the door and go downstairs.

Go south a bit and you should see three pots. Search the left pot for a
MEDICINAL HERB. The guy behind the counter to the south will restore your MP for
free. Then you could use your Heal spell, talk to the guy again to refill your
MP again, and repeat until you are at maximum HP and MP, therefore saving money
on Inn prices. I do not bother with this method because staying at an Inn is
faster and the cost is so cheap that I prefer the saved time more.

Equip your Bamboo Spear and leave Tantegel Castle through either the north or
south exit. You are now on the overworld screen. You can view your map now by
pressing X. Go east to the Town of Tantegel.

Just north of where you enter is an equipment shop. Buy a Leather Suit for 70G,
then go south to the Inn. The drawer in the southeast room of the Inn has a
CHIMAERA WING. Next to that room is the Vault. Talk to the lady and she will
deposit or withdraw gold or items for you.

East of the Inn and across the bridge is an item shop. Buy a Dragon Scale for
20G. You will have to equip it manually. Then leave town, because it's time to
grind for a bit. You can save 60G to buy the Oaken Club, but personally I go
straight for 180G so I can buy a Copper Sword.

Notice the building with the locked door. This is the Holy Water Shop.
Unfortunately you do not have access to this building right now, but remember it
for later.
