Walk around a bit making sure you stay close to the castle. In this area are
Slimes and She-Slimes. Fight them until you get to level 2. You can stay here to
reach level 3, but once I'm level 2 I like to go to the hills southwest of the
castle so I can start fighting Drackys. Do NOT go to the southern part of the
hills; the monsters there are stronger and they will kill you. If your HP falls
to 7 or less, go straight to the Inn, sleep and come back.

At level 3 you learn the Heal spell, which costs 3MP per use. Now I like to go
to a patch of hills northwest of Tantegel Castle and south of a cave surrounded
by sand. You can fight Ghosts here. Ghosts dodge more than the average monster.
Keep fighting until you have your Copper Sword.

At level 4 you learn the Sizz spell which does 16-20 damage if successful.

Do NOT cross the bridge southwest of the cave in the desert yet. Instead, earn
90G and head back to the Town of Tantegel to buy and equip a Leather Shield. Be
sure to have a Torch in your inventory. Torches light dark dungeons and do not
wear out until you leave the dungeon.

You should now be equipped as listed below.
