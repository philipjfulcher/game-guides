If you have already Quick Saved in the game, the option to load it will be
available. Otherwise, let us Venture Forth!

Go ahead and create a new adventure log. Select which log you want, then make a
name for yourself. In the NES version of the game, your stat growth differs
depending on your name, but not so much on the Switch. So choose any name you
want that's eight characters or less, select your message speed (which also
affects battle speed), select your volume levels, and you are all set to go!

Note: Message speed and volume levels can be changed by selecting the Misc.
option in your Main Menu and then selecting Settings.
