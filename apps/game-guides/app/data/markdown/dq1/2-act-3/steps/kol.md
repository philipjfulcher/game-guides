Starting from Galenholm, walk east. Instead of walking south to Tantegel,
continue walking east. Cross the bridge, head southeast and cross another
bridge. From here, head north until you see a village. This is the village of
Kol.

Head northwest in this town and you should see a sparkle about four steps south
of a square of water. Walk over to it and press A to search the area. You will
find the FAERIE FLUTE. Search the drawers north of there to find PLAIN CLOTHES
and a SEED OF STRENGTH. Seeds give permanent stat boosts to the Hero which is
really nice. Might as well use the seeds right away as the Hero is your only
party member.

Next to the drawers is a girl who will give you a Puff-Puff Massage for 20G. Ah,
the classic Puff-Puff Massage. It has been a staple of Dragon Quest ever since
it was released on the Famicom in 1986. Sadly, it was censored in the 1989 NES
version. Oh well.

That's all you can do in this town for now. Do not worry about getting Iron
Armour yet. The Craggy Cave coming up is pretty easy as it is. Unless you plan
to skip this cave (not recommended), make sure you have six Herbs and a Torch
before heading out.

If you are at level 9 you do not need the Torch because you will be given access
to the Glow spell, at a cost of 2MP per use. The upside to using this spell is
that it brightens a wider area than a Torch. The downsides are that the spell
wears off after so many steps and it costs MP. After 132 steps, the amount of
light you have will be reduced, and after another 132 steps, the effect of Glow
will be completely gone.
