title: QUAGMIRE CAVE
order: 2

If you chose to skip the Craggy Cave, go back to Galenholm and buy an Iron
Shield.

I recommend getting to level 9 before doing this next part. Make sure you are
equipped as listed below.

South of Kol is a poisonous swamp leading to Quagmire Cave. Giggity. It used to
be called the Swamp Cave. Let's go there now. Keep an eye on your HP as you go
through the swamp. Inside the cave, you can use Glow or a Torch if you want but
you do not even need those. Just go straight south along the long path until you
hit a wall, then go east, south, east, south, and finally west to the stairs.
