title: RIMULDAR
order: 3

You are now in the southeastern area of Alefgard. Roaming south of the cave are
Skeletons, Legerdemen, and two new monsters, the Iron Scorpion (good Resilience)
and the Bewarewolf. Iron Scorpions may use their turn to defend, which means you
do half the damage with your weapon or your spells that turn.

Keep heading south along the east coast until you see a town to the west. Walk
south around the impassable mountains to get there. Do not go further south
because there are tougher monsters down there. Welcome to the town of Rimuldar!

Go to the Equipment Shop and buy the Steel Broadsword for 1500G. Also, you can
buy an Iron Armour if you do not have one yet. Personally, I skip the Iron
Armour and go straight for the Full Plate Armour. Do not worry if you cannot
afford Full Plate Armour or Iron Armour right now. At level 10, Chain Mail is
fine for the monsters just outside of Rimuldar.

North of the Equipment Shop is a merchant who serves as the town's Item Shop.
West of him are two rooms. Search the drawer in the right one for a CHIMAERA
WING. Now go back to where you entered the town. If you hug the water, you can
walk north and west around the town to another shop. This shop sells... Magic
Keys! Finally!

In the Magic Key Shop, search the pots for ~120G and a SEED OF RESILIENCE. Buy 6
Keys from the shop owner, then leave and re-enter the town. Inside the Inn is a
chest that's blocked by two doors. Open both doors to get a SEED OF LIFE. Buy 2
more Magic Keys, then leave town.
