title: GRIND 2
order: 2

Once you are at level 5, head south to the hills just past the bridge. Here you
will want to grind 560G for the Iron Axe and 300G for the Chain Mail. You should
not purchase the Iron Shield because you can get a free one later. If you run
out of Medicinal Herbs and your HP is low, simply go back to Galennholm to rest
and restock.

There's another place you can grind. Remember the hills southwest of Tantegel
where you fought Drackys at level 2? If you go to the southernmost row of hills,
you can fight the same monsters as in the grinding spot mentioned in the
previous paragraph. Use the Town of Tantegel to rest and restock.

In these hills you can find Ghosts, Prestidigitators, Drackolytes and Scorpions.
Prestidigitators and Drackolytes can cast Sizz. Do not bother with physical
attacks on the Scorpions; use Sizz instead to one-shot them. In fact, Scorpions
are the only monsters I ever use Sizz on. I recommend getting the Iron Axe, the
Chain Mail and level 7 before attempting to head south of the hills, because you
may run into tougher monsters called Skeletons.

At level 7 you learn Snooze, with a cost of 2MP per use, which comes in handy
when dealing with Skeletons. Also, if you have the Iron Axe, you no longer need
to cast Sizz ever again, now that Scorpions can easily be taken out with
physical attacks.

South of these hills is the Craggy Cave. You probably saw it before as you were
grinding near Tantegel. You could bring a torch and 6 herbs and go here now as
the cave is not very difficult, if you are feeling brave or have played the game
before. But in this walkthrough I'm going to guide you to another village first.
