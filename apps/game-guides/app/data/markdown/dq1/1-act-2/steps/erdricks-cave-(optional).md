title: ERDRICK'S CAVE (OPTIONAL)
order: 0
---




The cave surrounded by sand is called Erdrick's Cave. This cave is entirely
optional and has no monsters or treasure, so you can skip it if you want.



**Floor B1**



Use your Torch, head south and take the first path east all the way,
go north a couple squares and continue east. Follow the eastern wall south to
the stairs at the southeast corner of the floor.



**Floor B2**



Follow the mostly linear path to find the Stone Tablet. You need three sacred
artefacts to reach the island where the Dragonlord's Castle is. Erdrick
entrusted these items to three Sages, whose descendants continue to guard them.
That's all for this cave, so let's get out of here.
