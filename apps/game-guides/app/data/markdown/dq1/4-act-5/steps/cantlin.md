Enter the town. Welcome to Cantlin! The Equipment Shop is south of the
northeastern stairs. There are two other equipment shops that sell equipment you
could have gotten in other towns. You need a key to access the shop as well as
the adjoining Magic Key Shop. The northwestern stairs lead to a Vault where you
can withdraw your gold. The Holy Water Shop is at the southeast corner of town.

Note that you cannot buy Medicinal Herbs or Torches here.

If you chose to grind 14800G and wait for the ultimate weapon, buy the Silver
Shield. If you chose to grind 24600G, get the Fire Blade as well. You can use
the Fire Blade as an item during battle to shoot flames at monsters. I really
do not recommend doing that, as your physical attack should be enough.

Search the drawer at the Inn for a SEED OF RESILIENCE. South of the Inn, use a
Magic Key to get to a drawer which holds... a MAGIC KEY. Also, the guy in here
talks about previously owning a shop in Damdara, the destroyed town in the
desert that you passed by earlier. Go south to a narrow hallway leading to the
eastern part of the town, then go north a bit to find a drawer with a SEED OF
MAGIC inside. That should be it for Cantlin. Zoom back to Tantegel, heal at the
Inn and save with the King.
