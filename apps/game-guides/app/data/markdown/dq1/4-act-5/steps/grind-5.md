title: GRIND 5
order: 4
---




On your run to Cantlin, you passed by some new monsters. Just south and west of
Damdara, you have Death Scorpions, Knight Errants who can cast Fizzle, Skeleton
Soldiers who can cast Heal, and Dark Skeletons that dodge a lot.

If you go further south, near the water but before crossing the bridge to go
east, you will run into some tougher monsters. Most notably, the Metal Slime! He
has more Resilience than the Dragonlord himself. Holy hell. Unfortunately for
him, the Metal Slime has the strength and spell capacity of a Drackolyte. Also,
he runs away a lot. Metal Slimes give 775 EXP a pop if you are lucky enough to
kill one. This is a favourite spot to grind for the whole game.

Also far south you have Hocus Chimaeras, who can cast Snooze and Sizz on you, as
well as Heal.

Near Cantlin are the same monsters you already met at Damdara.

At level 17 you will learn Midheal, an absolute necessity for beating the game.
