title: SAVE THE PRINCESS (OPTIONAL)
order: 2
---




Now it is time to save Princess Gwaelinâ€¦ if you want. Yup, this quest is
entirely optional. You do not have to save her to beat the game! Leave her to
rot for all the game cares; as long as you defeat the Dragonlord, you will get
the end-game credits. If you save her though, the ending will be a little
different, and more satisfying in my opinion.

Leave Tantegel and cast Holy Protection if you want to wipe out monster
encounters. Head east to the cave tunnel you previously travelled through when
going to Rimuldar. Once inside, cast Glow, then head east and south. Stay along
the eastern wall until you get to a locked door. Use a Magic Key, then continue
until you are just a few steps away from a dragon blocking a room entrance.
Quick Save here, then talk to the dragon for a battle.

Unfortunately, in the Switch version of the game there is no "But thou must."
Got to go back to the good old NES for that one. Oh well. I'm just a tad
disappointed I guess, that they would change an iconic line like that. Similar
to how they changed "...But you're still hungry" in the DS version of Chrono
Trigger. Damn you Square-Enix! Just kidding. Anyway, I'm digressing. Where was
I?

Oh yes, bringing Princess Gwaelin back home to Tantegel. You can Evac/Zoom back
if you want. Talk to the King and Gwaelin will give you the PRINCESS'S PLEDGE.
It tells you how many steps north, south, east or west Tantegel Castle is to
you, like a medieval GPS. Also, it tells you how much experience you need to get
to the next level.
