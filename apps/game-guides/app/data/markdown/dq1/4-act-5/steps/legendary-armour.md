title: LEGENDARY ARMOUR
order: 3
---




Remember Damdara, the town in the southern desert that was destroyed by
monsters? Remember that guy in Cantlin who was talking about a shop he used to
run there? It's time to enter that town.

In Damdara you can run into Cosmic Chimaeras who can cast Midheal. They can only
be taken out with physical attacks. Tearwolves do not have spells. Also, you
have Green Dragons, although be aware that these dragons have far less HP than
the dragon that is/was guarding Princess Gwaelin. Vis Magers can cast Fizzle and
a new spell, Sizzle, a more powerful Sizz spell which can do massive damage to
you. I have been killed more than once by these guys, especially when they get
the first move on you. Keep your health high, 70+ HP and Quick Save after every
battle and you should be fine.

Anyway, from where you entered, head south, then east across town. You should be
able to see a sparkle, indicating an hidden item. Approach the sparkle but stay
a few squares away. Heal up to max, and make sure you have at least 56 MP,
enough for a Fizzle cast and 18 Heal casts. If you do not, sleep at the Inn in
Galenholm and come back. Along with your Herbs, you should have at least 24
Heals to work with. Quick Save here; now you are ready to take on the guard of
this treasure, a Knight Aberrant.

| Remember when I said there is one particular monster in the game that I use  |
| Fizzle on? This is the monster. Cast Fizzle to prevent the Knight Aberrant   |
| from casting Snooze on you. It is guaranteed to work the first time. Attack  |
| and Heal if you go below 55 HP. Try not to use Medicinal Herbs until you run |
| out of MP. Even if the Knight Aberrant is constantly attacking, you should be|
| regaining a bit more HP than the monster can take, giving you a chance to hit|
| him once every few turns.                                                    |

| After 3 or 4 hits, the monster should go down, giving you access to a secret |
| sparkly treasure. Victory!                                                   |

For your troubles you get the mighty ERDRICK'S ARMOUR, the ultimate armour of
the game. Its defense is higher than all other armours. It lowers the damage of
Sizz, Sizzle and Fire attacks by 25%. It makes you invulnerable to the poisonous
swamp and damage tiles. On top of that, it heals 1 HP per step. This armour is
obscene.
