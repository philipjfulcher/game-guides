title: ROAD TO CANTLIN
order: 0

Once you have earned your gold, make sure you sleep at the Inn and have the
Faerie Flute with you along with maximum Medicinal Herbs and Magic Keys. Deposit
all your gold at the Vault and save with the King of Tantegel. This is going to
be a little bit of a walk through rough monster terrain.

Once you are past Chimaera territory, you will have to flee from every single
battle (except for Metal Slimes). I recommend Quick Saving after every couple
battles. At level 14 it is highly unlikely that you will die during the walk. If
you do die, do not worry. Your money is safe in the Vault.

Head back to the desert to the far south of Galenholm. Continue south until you
reach the sea, then go east across the bridge. Continue to follow the path
northeast, ignoring the next bridge. Eventually you should come to a bridge with
a poisonous swamp next to it. Cross the bridge and approach the town to the
south but keep at least four steps away from it. Heal up to maximum and Quick
Save your game. Now try to go into the town. It's mini-boss time!

| If you have the Faerie Flute, you should be able to defeat Golem without     |
| getting a scratch on you. Use the "Item" option and select your Faerie Flute |
| to lull the Golem to sleep. If he stays asleep, attack him. If he wakes up,  |
| use the Faerie Flute again. He will never get a turn in to attack. In the    |
| NES version, the Golem could wake up and attack the Hero in the same turn,   |
| but not so much on the Switch.                                               |

| For defeating him you get 2500 EXP and some pocket change. Now you can access|

At this point you should be at least close to getting level 15, at which you
will learn the Holy Protection spell. It wipes weak encounters off the map for
64 steps but does not work in dungeons. It is the same as using a Holy Water.
