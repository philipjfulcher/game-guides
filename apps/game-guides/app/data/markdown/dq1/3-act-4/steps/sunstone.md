On the northeast side of the Town of Tantegel, there is a shop behind a locked
door... doesn't seem like a great way to do business, if their front door is
always locked... anyway, they sell you Holy Water for 12G a pop. Holy Water
removes encounters with monsters much weaker than you, which removes the
inconvenience of getting into battles that give you almost nothing in experience
and gold. Basically, it's a time saver. Unfortunately Holy Water doesn't work in
dungeons, and it wears off after so many steps.

Enter Tantegel Castle and open the door to the treasure room. In the chests you
get ~345G, MAGIC KEY, SEED OF MAGIC, and SEED OF AGILITY. Go north and east and
open the locked door. There's a Magic Key shop in the northeast corner that
sells keys at 24G a pop. Also, you can walk outside the perimeter of the castle
in this area. Go one square east of the eastern Castle wall, then head south.
When you hit water, you can afford to go one more square east, then head south
to the stairs.

In the drawers to the right are a MEDICINAL HERB and a SEED OF LIFE. And in the
chest you get the SUNSTONE. Alright! One artefact found, two more to go.
