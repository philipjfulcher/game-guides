Zoom to Tantegel and walk eastward to Kol.

West of Kol is a path you may not have checked out yet. Follow the path as it
arcs northward, enter the Shrine and go down the stairs. Give the old man the
Lyre of Ire and he will give you access to a chest which contains the STAFF OF
RAIN. Alright! Two artefacts collected, one more to go. At this point I would
Zoom back to Tantegel Town to deposit the Staff of Rain and the Sunstone in the
Vault next to the Inn.
