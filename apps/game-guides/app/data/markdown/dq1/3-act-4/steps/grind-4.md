title: GRIND 4
order: 3
---




Unfortunately, it's time to grind again. I recommend fighting in Gold Golem
territory far to the south of Galenholm, because you are going to need gold.
Cross the bridge and head south into the desert where you will see a town. Do
not attempt to enter the town as it is destroyed and filled with powerful
monsters. Instead, do your grinding in the desert, making sure you stay north of
the town.

If you want the next sword upgrade and the best shield in the game, earn 24600G.
If you choose to wait until you get the ultimate sword in the game, you only
need 14800G. Also, you need to journey to a new town that sells this new
equipment. I recommend getting to level 14 for the next part.
