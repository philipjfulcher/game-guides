(1) Justice: After school, head out to the corridor and talk to Chihiro, tell her that “you want to talk” to her. She will refuse, but that's fine. You've finished this flag. (2) Invite Yuko to walk with you after the Chariot meeting. She will refuse, that’s fine. (3) Talk to Junpei at night for Hermit link.",
