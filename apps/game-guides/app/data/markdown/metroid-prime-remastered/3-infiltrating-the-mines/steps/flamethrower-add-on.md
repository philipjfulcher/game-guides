title: Flamethrower add-on
order: 9
---

Alright. Head to the Mine Security Station. Now, search for a Bendezium-made
wall and Power Bomb it. A computer should be behind it. Scan it to deactivate
the force field blocking the Plasma Beam door. Enter the door to grab the
FLAMETHROWER. The Flamethrower can now be used by charging up a Plasma Beam
shot, and pressing the Y button. Hold A for continuous fire. This move requires
10 Missiles to use, and then uses 5 Missiles with each second you use it. This
item is really useless. The only thing I can think of for using it for is when
you're stuck in a small room packed full of Space Pirates. I heard somewhere
that the Flamethrower actually enhances the distance of the Plasma Beam, but
that isn't even true. It's actually shorter of range than the beam itself. Head
all the way to the Central Dynamo and save. I'll end this short subsection
now.
