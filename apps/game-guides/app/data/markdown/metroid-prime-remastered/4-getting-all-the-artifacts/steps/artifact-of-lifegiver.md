Well, this is obvious. Head to the Tower of Light, since “Light” is
capitalized. Once there, drop into the water, move through the tunnel, and head
through the door once you emerge and grab the Artifact of Lifegiver. This one
was pretty self-explanatory, actually. Head all the way back to the Artifact
Temple in the Tallon Overworld. Walk to the center of the platform. A new
Artifact clue should be scannable! Grab it, and view the clue for the next one.
