**Early Morning**

- Nothing to interact with.

**After School**

- Press ![:sq:](https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/square.png) / ![:x1:](https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/x1.png) select “1F, Laboratory Hallway”, from here go to “1F Corridor” (it’s next to the stairs), now go straight to “1F Hallway” on the other side of the Corridor, from here you can either choose “Indoor Pool”, “Gymnasium” or “Field”. This is for the “Chariot” Social Link. It does NOT matter what you choose here. For this Guide, I choose “Field” and joined the Club but again, it doesn’t matter what you choose. During the following conversation select any options you want.
  - You will get Chariot (Track Team <- if you chose Field, if not something else will be here instead of Track Team but it doesn’t matter) Social Link Rank 1.

**Evening**

- During the conversation with Yukari pick any option you want.
- Talk to Mitsuru and go to Tartarus.
- The goal inside Tartarus is to get to Floor 16. Also, try to get a Persona with Hierophant and another one with Chariot Arcana. Those are needed to get more XP for the respective Social Link.
- On Floor 16 pick up Old Document 1 from the briefcase.
- During this visit of the Tartarus you can try and get ![:bronze:](https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/bronze.png) **Advantage Mine** by attacking an enemy from behind before they spot you.
- You can also try and get ![:bronze:](https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/bronze.png) **Grasping at Greed** by defeating a golden hand. For this you need a golden enemy, it appears randomly on any floor. Once you see it, attack it from straight behind or else it will run away. Do not worry if it disappears, you can try it on any visit of Tartarus.
- The following enemies can appear on any floor:
  - Cowardly Maya(Weak against Fire, Electric & Wind)
  - Grave Beetle (Weak against Wind / Resistant against Electric)
  - Muttering Tiara (Weak against Ice & Wind / Resistant against Fire)
  - Magic Hand (Weak against Fire / Resistant against Ice)
  - Merciful Maya (Weak against Ice, Zio & Wind / Resistant against Fire)
  - Obsessed Cupid (Weak against Ice / Resistant against Wind)
  - Trance Twins (Weak against Fire, Ice / Resistant against Zio)
- There will be three bosses on the way to Floor 16:
  - Floor 5: 3x Venus Eagle (They are weak to Pierce attacks)
  - Floor 10: 3x Dancing Hand (They are weak to Strike attacks)
  - Floor 14: Rampage Drive (only use elemental attacks against this enemy)
- Once you reached floor 16 and you got Old Document 01, you can leave Tartarus through the teleporter.
- Return to the dorm now
