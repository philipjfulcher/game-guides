**Loyalty Mission mop-up, Part 3:** finally, these two loyalty missions arenâ€™t possible to fail in the same way as the above, but they can go wrong based on a paragon or renegade points check. The check is based on a percentage of total points available to you at the time you play them rather than an arbitrary value, meaning you can successfully resolve them at any point - but by leaving it until later, you have a greater chance to have garnered what you need naturally.
