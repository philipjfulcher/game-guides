**OPTIONAL [Tali’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#tali-loyalty-mission) - Treason:** as well as being a mission you can fail, [the outcome has major repercussions in ME3](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11112-mass-effect-choices-consequences-decisions-that-matter-across-the-trilogy#mass-effect-2-major-choices-consequences). You can do this mission here, or, if you want very unique dialogue, you can save it for after you recruit Legion. If you do this, _you must do it at a very specific time later in the game_.

To get the best ending of this mission, both Kal’Reegar and Veetor must have survived the earlier Tali missions & be present.
