title: 'Acquire Reaper IFF'
---

**Acquire Reaper IFF:** complete this mission, and in it you’ll recruit one last character. If you decide to activate and recruit Legion, talk to it again without accessing the Galaxy Map to get its loyalty mission. If it doesn’t pop right away, change floors and come back as many times as it takes until it hands over the mission. When you get it, go straight to the Galaxy Map, open it only once, and go straight to Legion's mission, or Tali's loyalty mission if it's available.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** after acquiring the Reaper IFF, you can only trigger two specific missions without incurring negative consequences - Legion's Loyalty Mission and Tali's Loyalty Mission. If you take on ANY OTHER MISSION, some of Normandy's crew will die during the Suicide Mission. **Do not travel to any other location other than those two missions, not even to scan planets**.
