title: Grabbing the Morph Ball
order: 2
---

Yes, we're going to get the Morph Ball. So, let's head back to the Main Plaza.
Head back right, destroying the Beetles in your way, heading towards the door
that you first entered the Main Plaza. To your right, once you are facing it,
just past the half-pipe, is a door with a Blast Shield on it. Proceed to open
it, and head through a twisting hallway with a couple swarms of Scarabs. Past
this hallway is the Ruined Shrine. Climb up the stairs then drop to the center
to cause a massive swarm of Beetles to appear....

Destroy them all, and a bigger Beetle will come out. This is a Plated Beetle.
Scan it first. Now, in order to kill this thing, you have to shoot at its red
tail. But you can't get to it because the Beetle knows it's weakness, so it
hides it from you. The thing you have to do is wait for it to charge at you,
then quickly dash to the side. (Yes, you're doing Lock-on.) It's tail will be
exposed, so shoot a Missile (or two if you have the time) at it. Two Missiles
ought to get rid of it. That was a fairly easy fight, huh? Anyway, the path to
the Morph Ball will now appear. Grab the Morph Ball. Man, this was a small
subsection, huh? Anyway, now that you've got this move, you can exit this room.
If you want, go ahead and save at the Ruined Nursery, although you will have to
backtrack all the way to the Main Plaza. But hey, if you're enjoying this game,
you might as well save!
