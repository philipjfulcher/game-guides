Yes, as if you blatantly didn't notice, this section will help you recover
everything you lost, except for the Grapple Beam, which will be gotten later in
another section. Each subsection will tell you exactly what we'll get next, and
after every subsection, will be that “scans obtained” list, alrighty? Also,
from now on, I'll show how many items you've gotten, plus show your item

NEW INFO*
I've figured out that you can only see your scan percentage and item percentage
in-game in the European (PAL) version. In case you do have the PAL version, it
should be listed in the Log Book section of the Start Menu.

NOTE*
I will not be listing the Missile Launcher as a Missile Expansion in the item
list, instead, it'll be in the “Suit upgrades obtained” list. I wanted to write
this down so I wouldn't have a bunch of people telling me that I missed a
Missile Expansion in the item list.
