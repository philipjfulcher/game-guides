title: Ice Spreader add-on
order: 7
---



Alright, head to the Shore Tunnel, but while we're on the way, let's make a
stop in the Triclops Pit. (I'm assuming you took the elevator that has the
three doors around it in Chozo Ruins.) Anyway, kill the Flying Pirates so they
won't be a nuisance to you while you're doing this. Alright, from the platform
you are standing on, stand on the boxes at the edge, and turn on your X-Ray
Visor. You should see an invisible platform. Space Jump onto it, then carefully
jump across platforms until you get to what seems like a MISSILE EXPANSION.
If you turn off your Visor, you'll see that it's a pillar. Shoot a Missile at
it to really reveal the Expansion, making it grabbable, so grab it.

Alright, now you can head into the Shore Tunnel, once there, scan the tunnel to
find it is made of Bendezium. Place a Power Bomb to blow it open. Head under
the tunnel to get the ICE SPREADER. Now, when you press the Y Button while your
Ice Beam is fully charged, you'll shoot a blast of ice, which, when it hits,
leaves a huge sheet of ice, freezing any foes that get caught in the ice. This
attack uses up 10 Missiles, so use this sparingly. Well, since there really
isn't a way to lengthen this subsection here, then I guess we're all done.
