title: THE X-RAY VISORZ! THEY DO NOTHING!!!
order: 6
---



If you don't watch the Simpsons, then you won't get this joke of a joke making
fun of Arnold Schwarznegger. *gasps for air* Anyway, head back to the Great
Tree Hall and start climbing. Somewhat at the top, you'll see a tower with a
Spider Ball track spiraling around it. Head to the top somehow, and head to the
Life Grove Access, which is really just a Morph Ball maze. You'll actually
notice a point in the maze where it is shaped like a full circle. Using the
Boost Ball, get to the top of the maze. Bomb around the top to uncover a
MISSILE EXPANSION. Continue to the Life Grove, where you can grab the X-RAY
VISOR. ....Since that was short, I'll continue this subsection until we get a
few expansions. Anyway, to exit, place a Power Bomb once right smack in the
middle of the room to uncover the WHOLE Life Grove. Proceed to climb up and out
of here, and some Chozo Ghosts will appear. Take them all out to lunch, then
proceed to exterminate them. (o_o......j/k about the lunch part)

Once they're all gone, head out of the Life Grove by heading through the exit
that the cutscene showed you, then head to the Chozo Ruins. Alright, from here,
(you should be at the Reflecting Pool) head over to the Furnace. Once there,
kill the Chozo Ghosts, then look for the part of the ground that is really
cracked. Power Bomb that floor section. This should open up a half-pipe. Use
it to reach the elevated Spider Ball track. Head through the maze of Spider
Ball tracks to get to a MISSILE EXPANSION at the end. Now, head to the Watery
Hall, then jump in the water. (which is free of toxins now since you beat
Flaaghra) Once you're at a deep end of the water, find a tunnel. This tunnel
should lead to another MISSILE EXPANSION. I also forgot to tell you: now that
you have the Ice Beam and everything, Chozo Ghosts will start to appear in most
of the rooms instead of the Hall of the Elders. The reason I pointed this out
is because someone on the message boards was wondering if this was supposed to
happen. So, anybody else wondering that and reading this will be informed...
Anyway, once you got that Expansion, head to the Ruined Fountain.

Once there, head into the door that we haven't gone through yet. Head through
the tunnels until you get to the Magma Pool. Grapple across, then plant a Power
Bomb once on the other side. The wall in front of you should break and reveal a
Chozo Lore, and a POWER BOMB EXPANSION. Get both, then head through the door.
In the following hallway, head to the next door, but don't open it. Instead,
Morph into a ball, and roll through the plant with red leaves. The red leaves
hide a tunnel, which contains a MISSILE EXPANSION. Once it's grabbed, continue
into the Training Chamber, where two Chozo Ghosts will appear. Once you get rid
of them, the mouths of the statues on both sides of the half pipe will blow
open, revealing Morph Ball Slots.

The Slot on the left will reveal the exit, the one on the right will lower a
piston. So, activate 'em, left to right, then head into the piston quickly, as
you've got a time limit once it's lowered. The piston will take you up to a
Spider Ball track. Use it to get to a tunnel, which in turn will get you to a
small room with “windows” overlooking the Chamber. This room holds an ENERGY
TANK. Now, head towards the exit, moving through the maze with the pistons, and
emerge at another balcony overlooking the Main Plaza. Before you drop down,
though, use the Grapple Point up here to swing yourself to a MISSILE EXPANSION.
We should be pretty much done here....for now. Head to the Magmoor Caverns from
here, and I'll end this subsection.
