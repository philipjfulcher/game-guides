title: Artifact of Chozo
order: 7
---



“In one of Tallon's far corners, a Grove of life lies.
Reveal the pillar beneath the waves to find the
Artifact of Chozo.”

You heard the clue, get your butt over to the Life Grove, where you got your
X-Ray Visor. Once there, head into the water and blow away the metal blockage
with a Bomb. (It should have some sort of a symbol on it.) A pillar should rise
and reveal a Spinner. Use it to reveal a small nook where the Artifact of Chozo
is held. Grab it, then head back to the Artifact Temple. Stand at the center
of the platform, and two more Artifact clues will be scannable! Get them, then
read the next clue.
