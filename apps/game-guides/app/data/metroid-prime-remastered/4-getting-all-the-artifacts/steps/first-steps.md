You may notice that after you get the Phazon Suit, you won't progress through
the game's storyline anymore. That is because there are 12 Chozo Artifacts to
find. Now, Artifacts that you collect are a little strange, because when you
collect one, it will add a scan to your Log Book, plus will add a percent in
your item percentage. (You can get the scan early by grabbing the Artifacts'
hint locations.) For this reason, just for this section, I added the Artifacts
as a seperate list in the scan box and the item list. Also, on the beginning of
each subsection, I will show the exact hint that the game gives you when you
scan it. Now, let's get busy.
