title: Artifact of Wild
order: 4
---



“A Sunchamber high atop our ruined home became
the nest of a great beast, and a source of corruption.
Many Chozo Spirits have been drawn to this tainted place.
Release their bond to the world to claim the Artifact
of Wild.”

This clue's not as clear as the others, but you can still guess that it's
talking of the Chozo Ruins. Although, this one clearly states the name of the
room you should go to. So, head there. But, not the original way, because that
way is blocked. Instead, head to the Magmoor transport. Once there, take the
left door. You should come to a Sun Tower. Get rid of the War Wasps, then use
Missiles to destroy their hives so that they won't harass you anymore. Now,
scan the Chozo Lore here. (Last one, yay!) Now, there should be a plate of
Cordite on both sides of the room. Blast them both with Super Missiles, and
scan the runic symbols behind them. Now, turn on your Thermal Visor. Look all
around the four columns here for the last two runic symbols.

Once they're all activated, the rest of the Spider Ball track should be
revealed. Climb up them, being careful of the Oculus's, and head through the
door at the top. As soon as you do enter, a Chozo Ghost will see you, and
vanish through a wall...... Just keep moving, and into the Sunchamber. A number
of Chozo Ghosts will appear. Take them all out, using your X-Ray Visor to see
them. Once they're all defeated, the Artifact of Wild will appear where
Flaaghra was planted. I know you hate to stand in a previously dangerous spot,
but please do so you can grab this Artifact. Now, let's see what the next hint
will give us.
