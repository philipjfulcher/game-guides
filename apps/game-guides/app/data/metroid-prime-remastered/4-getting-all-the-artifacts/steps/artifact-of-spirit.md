> “A tall cave stands at Phendrana's Edge. Seek the unseen
> entrance at its top to find the Artifact of Spirit.”

Basically, just head to Phendrana's Edge. Once there, start climbing to the
top. Now, turn on your X-Ray Visor, and slowly descend down the ledges. You
should see one ledge that has a transparent wall. Power Bomb it to reveal the
holding place of the Artifact of Spirit. Now, head back to the Artifact Temple,
and when you stand at the center of the platform, one last clue should be
available! Scan it, then read the clue.....
