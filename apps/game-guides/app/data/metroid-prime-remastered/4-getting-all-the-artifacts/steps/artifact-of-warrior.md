title: Artifact of Warrior
order: 6

“A room of Research lies within the mines.
A corrupted invader is trapped there.
Defeat this creature to claim the Artifact of Warrior.”

A room of Research in the mines...Phazon Mines! Head to the Elite Research room
in the Phazon Mines, and you'll see an Elite Pirate in stasis. Blow open the
pod with a Power Bomb and he'll break out. This poor guy looks as if he's been
exposed to high levels of Phazon recently. Scan him first, then beat him like
any other Elite Pirate. (Except I think he's stronger.) When he's gone,
claim the Artifact of Warrior. It might be a good idea to save somewhere now.
Alright, let's look at the next clue.
