title: Artifact of Truth
order: 1
---

While on top of your ship, if you look straight ahead, you'll see a door on a
high ledge. Now, look a little bit to your left, (past the waterfall) and you
should see some ledges. Climb up them, and when you get to the top, head
through the tunnel, and head into that door you saw. Go through the straight
hallway filled with Tangle Weeds and Seedlings, and you'll come to a scenic
glass-made tunnel, where you can see the Impact Crater. The symbol right in the
middle of the enlarged part of the tunnel is a Pirate Log, so scan it. Man, the
cutscene showed everything around here, huh? Anyway, head into the Temple,
which is mysteriously floating...... Once you enter the Artifact Temple, you
should see a window showing a platform below. Take the hallway to the right to
grab a Chozo Lore, and head into the left hallway to grab another Chozo Lore.
You'll notice this hallway leads downward, so take it, and step onto that
platform. You should see another one of those symbols, like it's a Pirate Log,
but it isn't, and is colored pale blue. Grab it, and you should have the
Artifact of Truth! Now, scan the totems here. You should grab the clues for all
Artifacts except 4. Once you've gotten them, head back to your ship and save.
Now, let's see what the Artifact of Strength clue gives us....
