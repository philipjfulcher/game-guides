title: Artifact of Newborn
order: 12
---



“Invaders mine the depths in their greed.
Forge a tunnel of the Great Poison to claim
the Artifact of Newborn.”

Yep, we'll have to head back to the Phazon Mines, but in the deep area, into
the Phazon Mining Tunnel. Once you get to the bottom of the maze, where the
Phazon is. Keep bombing the rocks to “forge a path.” At the end, you'll get the
Artifact of Newborn. Hooray! Now we have all 12 Artifacts! Now, head back to
the Artifact Temple, and stand in the center of the platform. All of the Chozo
Totems will glow, and the central Totem will reveal a mystic light, to allow
access to the Impact Crater....but something is definitely going wrong.....
