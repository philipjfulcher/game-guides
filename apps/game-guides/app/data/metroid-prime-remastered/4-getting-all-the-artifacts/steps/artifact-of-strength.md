title: Artifact of Strength
order: 2
---



“The heat of Magmoor was a test for many
warriors. A Shrine in their honor holds
the Artifact of Strength.”

Magmoor is an immediate clue right there, so let's go there. Head all the way
to the Monitor Station. Climb up to the door like before, except, while on the
catwalk to the door, look around for a platform. Space Jump onto it, then Space
Jump to another catwalk above. Once at the top of the tower, get on top of the
Spinner and use it to extend a bridge. Once it's fully extended, get to its end
and Space Jump to the rock ahead. Follow the rock ledges until you reach a
door, which behind the door is the Shrine. Grab the Artifact. Now, plant a
Power Bomb right in front of the statue, and the floor should blow open,
revealing a path. Follow it to a POWER BOMB EXPANSION. Exit using the Morph
Ball hole and you'll get dropped off at the Fiery Shores.
