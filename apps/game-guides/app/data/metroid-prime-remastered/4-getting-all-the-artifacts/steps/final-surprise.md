title: Final Surprise

An object will appear over the horizon, and it's heading towards the Temple at
a high speed...it's Meta Ridley! He flies right into the center column,
destroying it, thus canceling the Crater access. Then, he'll face Samus, ready
to fight.....

---------------------
**BOSS: Meta Ridley**

To me, this boss battle is the coolest of the game, as it plays a remix of the
Super Metroid Ridley battle. W00t!! Scan this guy first. Now, this boss has a
number of aerial attacks. He has a Pulse Beam that he shoots from his mouth, he
also fires Missiles from his back. He can also fly by at a high speed and drop
bombs, which are hard to avoid. After hitting him a few times, he'll start
doing another attack, flying right over the platform, and performing a
crash-landing. Don't be in close vicinity to him or you'll get damaged by the
attack. When he lands, he'll roar, then take off and fly under the platform,
then he'll reappear again. Now, for the offensive. Basically, just shoot your
Plasma Beam at his chest. That's all you have to do. Anyway, keep dodging his
attacks and damaging him, and when he's down to one-fourth energy left, his
wings will burn off, and he will land, thus signalling the second part of the
battle, and he will reveal his attacking prowess on the ground....

He now basically just starts to ram you. Frequently dash to the side to avoid
it. After he does a few rams, he will stop, and open his mouth to roar. When he
does that, shoot a Missile at his mouth. He will open up the inner part of his
chest. Use the Rapid-Fire Missiles trick and start shooting at that part. His
chest will eventually close up, and will start the ramming again. Keep doing
this process until he's about a sliver left of health left, in which his rams
will be faster and more frequent. It is harder to avoid his rams now, so try as
hard as you can. Once you get another chance, a few more Missiles should cause
him extreme pain. The battle will end, and the statues of the Temple will glow,
and will fire lasers right at Ridley's chest, and he'll back up, and fall off
the edge, his robotic-self will be destroyed at impact.
---------------------

Samus will look down at where Meta Ridley fell, and will turn around to see
Chozo Ghosts filling the spots where the destroyed totems laid. They'll gather
up their power, and will create a portal. Step inside to be whisked off....
