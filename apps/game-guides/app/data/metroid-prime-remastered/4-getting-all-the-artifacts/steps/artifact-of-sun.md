“Near Phendrana's shores, a Temple stands.
Thaw the frozen waters flowing from the Elder
to find the Artifact of Sun.”

Alright, head to Phendrana Shores in the Drifts, and enter the Chozo Temple.
Remember that statue at the top of the Temple that had its hands frozen? Head
to the statue and melt the ice. (Plasma Beam) Once you do that, Morph into a
ball on the statue's hands, and a tunnel will open up. Head through and collect
the Artifact of Sun. Now, let's look at the next clue.
