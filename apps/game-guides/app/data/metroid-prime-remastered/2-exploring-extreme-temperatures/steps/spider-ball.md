This is, once again, one of the shortest subsections in this walkthrough, like
the Thermal Visor. Anyway, since we saved in the Ruined Courtyard, let's head
towards that door that wasn't powered. Now, remember what we did in the
Research Core? We'll have to find a power conduit right next to the door.
(Thermal Visor) Once you find it, you'll realise that it's blocked by Cordite.
Shoot the blockage with a Super Missile, then activate the power conduit.
(You'll need to always use the Wave Beam in order to activate a power conduit,
remember that.)

The door should be openable now. Just head through the Quarantine Access, going
through wooden Morph Ball bridges over a bottomless pit....don't worry, there
are boundaries on the bridge. Just keep going until you reach the Quarantine
Access. You'll see a huge pile of big rocks in the center. A cutscene will
occur, showing Samus walking towards the pile. All of a sudden, a rock will
break out of the ground behind Samus, and she'll turn around to it. Now, the
big pile of rocks will form into a huge rock monster, named Thardus, the
subject of Project Titan. (If you read the Pirate Logs, you should know what
I'm talking about...)

---------------------
**BOSS: Thardus**

This guy may be a little hard if you don't understand his battle pattern.
However, once you figure it out, he'll be a piece of cake. Scan this guy first.
Thardus only has a few attacks, and I'll explain each attack, and how to avoid
it. First is, he summons rocks out of the ground, and throws them at you. Just
shoot at the rocks to get rid of them. The rocks may also drop some pick-ups if
you need any. His second attack is pounding the ground and creating a line of
ice. Just dash to the side or double jump to avoid this. If you get frozen,
press B multiple times to break free. If you get frozen while in Morph Ball
mode, plant Bombs to escape. His third attack is morphing into a ball and
rolling around. Since he always rolls after you first, morph into a ball
yourself and use Boost Ball to escape. That's basically it for the attacks, now
I shall explain how to damage him. If you turn on your Thermal Visor, you'll
notice that a part of Thardus's body is lighted, indicating heat. Shoot at that
appendage until the outer sealing breaks open, revealing Phazon ore. Since
Phazon ore is exposed, your Thermal Visor will overload, thus all you can see
is gamma white. So, switch to your normal visor.

Now that some Phazon ore is exposed, shoot at it until it blows up. Notice
that his health goes down a little bit: this sequence is how to damage him.
He'll always use his third attack after you get rid of one of his appendages,
so be prepared. Also, make sure you don't have Thermal Visor on when you're
battling the rocks he summons, because explosions can also overload the Thermal
Visor. Anyway, after you destroy three of his appendages, he'll realise that he
needs to use strategy, so he starts summoning a blizzard, thus hindering your
view. Luckily, your Thermal Visor will allow you to still see his weak spots,
but you'll have to be dangerously close to Thardus when getting the exposed
Phazon ore. Anyway, continue through this until he has one appendage left,
which seems to be his head. He'll get really mad now, and will start using his
rolling attack more potently now. Luckily, the blizzard has ended at this time,
so you can see even better than before. (really) Since he's really mad now, be
prepared for a lot of dodging. Anyway, destroy his last appendage, and he will
fall, almost right on top of Samus.
---------------------

Thardus will break open, revealing a few Ultra Energys, Missile pick-ups, and
the....dun, dun, dun.....SPIDER BALL!! Now, you see the Spider Ball tracks
around here? Well, scan one first, then use it to head to an entrance to a
Magmoor Transport. We are not going to exit back to the Ruined Courtyard. Use
the elevator when you get there. We'll end this subsection, thus ending the
Extreme Temperatures section.
