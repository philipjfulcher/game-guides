**Visiting Illium:**

For a nice change of scenery, head to Illium, the next hub planet and home to another recruit. Catch up with Liara, 
but do not take her up on the offer to help her with the Shadow Broker after completing her short side quest. We'll save that for later. There's other side quests you can do on Illium also, plus new shops and so on.
