3.  **Loyalty Mission mop-up, Part 3:** finally, these two loyalty missions aren’t possible to fail in the same way as the above, but they can go wrong based on a paragon or renegade points check. The check is based on a percentage of total points available to you at the time you play them rather than an arbitrary value, meaning you can successfully resolve them at any point - but by leaving it until later, you have a greater chance to have garnered what you need naturally.
    *   **[Jack’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#jack-loyalty-mission) - Subject Zero:** after completing this simple mission, Jack and Miranda will have a fight. You must resolve it with a Paragon or Renegade dialogue option to keep both of them loyal; taking a side revokes one character’s loyalty.
    *   **[Zaeed’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#zaeed-loyalty-mission) - The Price of Revenge:** at the end of the mission, you must make a choice between Zaeed’s wishes and innocent lives. Renegade Shepard can easily side with Zaeed and get his loyalty; Paragon Shepard must pass a difficult check to talk him down and keep him loyal.
