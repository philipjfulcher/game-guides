title: "The Point of No Return"
--- 

**The Point of No Return:** at this point, you should have one story mission on your plate - the Reaper IFF. Once you tackle this mission, itâ€™s a rollercoaster ride to the end - so make sure you have all character loyalties, Normandy upgrades, have completed side missions, and done everything you want to do on hub planets. [Treat starting the Reaper IFF Mission as ME2's point of no return](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11149-mass-effect-2-point-of-no-return-what-mission-you-should-finish-all-your-quests-before-starting).
