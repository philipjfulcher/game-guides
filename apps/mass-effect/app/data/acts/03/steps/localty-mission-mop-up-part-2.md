2.  **Loyalty Mission mop-up, Part 2:** these missions are next, but you need to be more careful - it’s possible to fail these loyalty missions entirely. If you do, the character remains in your party but remains disloyal, which can be a problem for the suicide mission:
    *   **[Thane’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#thane-loyalty-mission) - Sins of the Father:** you must stay close to your target and get the information you ended at the end. 
    *   **[Samara’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#samara-loyalty-mission) - The Ardat-Yakshi:** you must successfully lure Morinth and not lose her in order to obtain loyalty.
    *   **OPTIONAL // [Tali’s Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#tali-loyalty-mission) - Treason:** as well as being a mission you can fail, [the outcome has major repercussions in ME3](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11112-mass-effect-choices-consequences-decisions-that-matter-across-the-trilogy#mass-effect-2-major-choices-consequences). You can do this mission here, or, if you want very unique dialogue, you can save it for after you recruit Legion. If you do this, _you must do it at a very specific time later in the game_.
        *   To get the best ending of this mission, both Kal’Reegar and Veetor must have survived the earlier Tali missions & be present.
