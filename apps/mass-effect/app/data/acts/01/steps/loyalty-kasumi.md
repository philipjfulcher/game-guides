**[Kasumi's Loyalty Mission](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11111-mass-effect-2-loyalty-missions-consequences-how-to-gain-loyalty-resolve-conflicts#kasumi-loyalty-mission) - Stealing Memory:**

This is Kasumi's loyalty mission, and we're making it the first of these missions we do primarily because it has some great rewards and resources, including the best SMG Mass Effect 2 has to offer. If your choice of character class relies on the SMG, do this mission now. Otherwise, you can bump it back to after recruiting Archangel.
