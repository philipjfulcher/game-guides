title: "Recruit the Convict & Warlord"
---

**Recruit the Convict & Warlord:**
Two more recruitment missions remain. You can do them in whichever way around you want. We recommend the Convict first, but it really doesnâ€™t matter - make the decision based on which of the two will slot into your party best right now.

- **Dossier: The Convict:** your team currently lacks a dedicated Biotic - so to fill that mage-shaped hole in your ME2 squad, go recruit Jack next.
- **Dossier: The Warlord:** next, go and grab Grunt, Mass Effect 2's Krogan squad member. After completing the mission, he doesn't automatically join your party - go and get him on the lower floors of the Normandy if you want to have him join the crew properly.
