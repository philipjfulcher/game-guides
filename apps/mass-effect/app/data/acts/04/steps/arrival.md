**Arrival:** this DLC was the last released for ME2, and basically is a little mini prologue to Mass Effect 3. It actually becomes available any time after Horizon, but it totally fits best into the story if you do it here, at the very end of ME2. After itâ€™s complete, save - and move on to ME3 - which we also have an [ME3 mission order guide](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11183-mass-effect-3-mission-order-best-sequence-for-all-priority-dlc-and-side-quests) for, too!
