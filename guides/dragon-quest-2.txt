<<----------------------------i. PRE-JOURNEY [WK01]--------------------------->>


An option to load a Quick Save will be there if you have already done that.
Otherwise, Venture Forth!

Create a new adventure log and select the file you want to save at. Make a name
for the Hero that is eight characters or less, select your message speed, volume
levels and confirm.

Note : If you try to put in "Jesus" or "Christ" as the Hero's name, you will
       get a message saying you cannot choose that name. Shoot me an e-mail if
       you discover any more names that cannot be used and I will list them.


You get a little backstory concerning the events of Dragon Quest and what
happened after the Dragonlord's defeat. Then you get some cutscenes. Hargon's
monsters sack Moonbrooke Castle, killing the guards and the King. However, a
lone guard manages to escape. What becomes of the Princess is unknown.



<<---------------------------ii. MIDENHALL 1 [WK02]--------------------------->>


The guard manages to get to Midenhall and delivers the bad news to the King
before dying. So Hargon is the main villain of this game. Now it's up to you,
son of the King of Midenhall and descendant of both Erdrick and the Hero/Gwaelin
from the original Dragon Quest, to defeat this self-styled "High Priest" to save
the rest of the world from his wrath.

We play as Mega Man this time? Last time, it was Mario! Why do these Heroes look
like protagonists from Nintendo games?

Follow the King down the stairs. He will tell you to seek out your companions
who are also of Erdrick's line, making them your relatives. Probably cousins.
Anyway, the King will give names for your relatives before asking you to
confirm. If you say "No," you can choose your own names for them.

Note : If you try to put in "Jesus" or "Christ" as a party member's name, you
       will get a message saying you cannot choose that name. Shoot me an e-mail
       if you discover any more names that cannot be used and I will list them
       in a future version.

Once their names are set, finish talking to the King, then open the Treasure
Chest next to you for a COPPER SWORD and 50G. You can use either the Item Menu
or the Misc. Menu to equip your new weapon.

To save with the King, simply walk out of the Castle through the southern exit
and re-enter.

<<--------------------------iii. GRIND 1 [WK03]------------------------------->>


Ok, it is time to do a short grind. I recommend doing it in the hills just north
of Midenhall. Make sure you stay on the southern few rows of hills because
further north are tougher monsters. There are only two monsters here, Slimes and
Mauluscs, both of which are quite weak. If you run into anything else, you are
too far north.

The goal is to get to level 3 and buy the Leather Shield for 90G. I recommend
also grabbing a Medicinal Herb and an Antidotal Herb. Medicinal Herbs heal some
HP and Antidotal Herbs cure Poison.

A person in Midenhall mentioned a town to the west called Leftwyne. Rest at the
Inn, then start travelling west. Once you pass some sand you will run into a few
more monsters. Because you got the Leather Shield, the Iron Ants and Drackies
should be no match for you.

Either go north around the impassible mountains or go through the northern part
of the Poisonous Swamp. You should be able to see a town now. Enter the town.

Welcome to Leftwyne! Go to the Equipment Shop to the northwest and go up the
stairs. Position yourself south of the lady and talk to her. Wait for her to
move, then search the drawer for a TOMBOLA TICKET. Unfortunately, the Tombola
game in Leftwyne is behind a locked door, and you don't have any keys yet. I
recommend putting it in the Vault for later. Talk to the lady in the Item Shop
to gain access to the Vault.

An old guy in town says he cannot make the journey north to Cannock. We were
told earlier by the King of Midenhall to seek the Prince of Cannock out. So
let's go there. Cannock Castle is straight north. You can't miss it.

Welcome to Cannock! The guy south of the room with the Treasure Chest serves as
Cannock's Equipment Shop, but you probably can't afford anything yet.

Talk to the King to find out the Prince of Cannock is at the Wellspring of the
Hero. This is your next destination.

Note : If you do not talk to the King, you will not be able to trigger the next
       event, so be sure that you do.

Rest at the Inn and make sure you have 2 Medicinal Herbs and 2 Antidotal Herbs
in your inventory before you leave. You may not need them, but they are there
for insurance. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.

Start walking east, making sure you stay north of the impassable mountains.
Cross some sand and a bridge. Eventually you should be able to see Wellspring
Cave. Do not go east of the cave because you may run into a Magus which are too
tough for you right now. Enter the cave.

\______________________________________________________________________________/


The Wellspring Cave has the same monsters you met before along with a new
monster called a Cobra King. Be careful as they have a chance of poisoning you.

Head north and east to some water. Get the Chest south of you which contains a
MEDICINAL HERB. Now take the eastern path south, then west to find a chest with
~84G. Head back to the water. The eastern path in the darkness leads to some
stairs. Downstairs is a guy who talks about the Wellspring, but there's no
treasure here, so skip it if you want. Take the northern path and follow it
east, west and southwest to a Treasure Chest containing an ANTIDOTAL HERB.

Head north to the Wellspring of the Hero. Talk to the guy and he will heal your
HP up to full for you. Answer "Yes" to his question to learn that the Prince is
in Midenhall looking for you.

Note : If he does not mention the Prince, it means you did not talk to the King
       of Cannock, which means you will have to backtrack to see him.

Head back to the water, then head west and south to the exit.



<<------------------------vii. PRINCE OF CANNOCK [WK07]----------------------->>


From Wellspring Cave, head southwest, ignoring the bridge. When you see a
Poisonous Swamp to your east, go to the southern part. Keep an eye on your HP as
you go through the swamp. Head south through the hills and you should be able to
see Midenhall.

Have a talk with your father the King to learn that the Prince, having not found
you here, is on his way back to Cannock. Leave Midenhall and head west like you
are going back to Cannock. But make a pit stop at Leftwyne first.

Talk to the guy at the Inn. It's the Prince of Cannock! He will join your party
at level 1, but he has a Heal spell which will really come in handy and costs 2
MP. I suggest you get a Leather Shield for the Prince. Also get the Chain Sickle
for the Prince when you can afford it. Bring 2-3 Antidotal Herbs with you before
you leave.

Note : Inn prices will be double what they were before.



<<----------------------------viii. GRIND 2 [WK08]---------------------------->>


Since the Prince starts at level 1, we need to grind for a bit. Stay around
Cannock until the Prince reaches level 3 and has the Chain Sickle. At level 3
the Prince learns Sizz, which deals some damage to all enemies in a group at a
cost of 2 MP.

Once the Prince is level 3 my suggestion is to grind west of Cannock near the
cave. Go west of Cannock and cross the bridge. Continue west through the narrow
forested passage between the mountains and you should see a cave. Grind in the
hills until the Hero is at least level 7 and the Prince is at least level 6. Use
Cannock if you need to rest, restock or save.

In the territory near the cave are Cobra Kings who have a chance to poison your
Party with every hit. Army Ants can call other Army Ants in battle. Healslimes
can Heal, as their name suggests. Magus can cast Sizz which will deal damage to
all party members. Fat Rats have no special ability.

At level 6 the Prince learns Squelch, which removes the Poison status from your
party member at a cost of 3 MP.

Go back to Cannock and get a Chain Sickle for the Hero and sell his Copper
Sword. Make sure you have 2-3 Antidotal Herbs, a couple Medicinal Herbs and a
Chimaera Wing for the upcoming cave, just in case the Prince runs out of MP.

The next part is optional but I strongly recommend it. Head for the cave west of
Cannock.

<<----------------------ix. LAKE CAVE (OPTIONAL) [WK09]----------------------->>


Welcome to the Lake Cave! The main item you are looking for here is not required
to beat the game but it will definitely help. You will need it if you want to
talk to everybody or play Tombola in some towns. Without this item, it will be
more difficult to locate an item which helps you find other items. Also, it will
be more difficult to get an excellent piece of armour and the best weapon for
the Princess later in the game. I highly recommend you do this part. Plus, it is
relatively short walk.



Floor B1


On this floor are Fat Rats, Healslimes, Cobra Kings and a new monster, Somnol
Ants. Somnol Ants have the spell Snooze which has a 50% chance of putting a
party member to sleep. A single cast hits all party members.

Go south and open the Treasure Chest to get a SEED OF AGILITY. I suggest saving
it for the Princess. Head west and south past the water. Enter the darkened area
to find a Treasure Chest containing a TOMBOLA TICKET. Exit this room and head
west and south to the stairs.



Floor B2


Head west and south. Enter the dark room to the east to a Chest with a SEED OF
LIFE. I suggest either wait for the Princess or use it on the Prince. Continue
south and get the ANTIDOTAL HERB in the western room. Go south to the fork and
take the western path, leading to a room that has a CHIMAERA WING and ~194G. Now
go back to the fork and take the path east and south. At the end of this path
you will find the SILVER KEY, which opens up all doors lined with silver.

Now that you have found the main item of the dungeon, we can exit. Head north as
far as you can, then head east to the stairs.



Floor B1


Follow the path north and east to the water. Head eastward north of the water,
then head north to the stairs. If you still have Herbs or MP left and you do not
have at least 564G yet, grind next to the stairs or outside in the hills south
of the Lake Cave until you have the gold.



<<--------------------------x. GWAELIN'S GATE [WK10]-------------------------->>


Use a Chimaera Wing to get back to Cannock quickly. Sell both Leather Armours
for 113G apiece, earning you 226G. You should now have 790G, which is enough to
get 2 Chain Mails for your Hero and your Prince as well as a stay at the Inn.

With your new Key, you can access a drawer in northwestern Midenhall. It
contains a TOMBOLA TICKET. You can also access a Jail to the northeast if you
want to check that out, though you cannot do anything there at the moment.

In Leftwyne, using your Silver Key on the door in the Equipment Shop gives you
access to the Tombola game. For the cost of a Tombola Ticket, you can play a
slot-machine type game. Check out the Tombola section of this walkthrough to
learn more.

When you are ready, head west and a bit south of Cannock to a Shrine, called
Gwaelin's Gate. The guy in here will ask you if you've been to the Shrine south
of Midenhall, which I will call the Midenhall Shrine. You can check that Shrine
out if you want, but there is nothing you can do or get there right now, except
talk to one guy. He mentions getting both the Silver Key and the Gold Key.
Nothing major.

Talk to the guards and they will let you pass. Go down the stairs. I call this
tunnel Cannock Tunnel. Anyway, follow the eastern tunnel south, then west to the
next stairs. The western tunnel leads to a dead-end island.

Head south past the trees and hills. Eventually you will see a town. Enter it.

\______________________________________________________________________________/


Welcome to Moonahan! The Equipment and Item Shops are to the southeast. North of
them is the Tombola game, and north of that is the House of Worship. The lady to
the right in the House of Worship serves as the Vault. The guy to the west will
save your game.

If you talk to the dog, it will follow you around while you are in town.

You probably do not have enough money to buy anything new here yet. However,
there is no need to worry about that because the next walk is fairly short and
the monsters are not terribly difficult. Buy a Chimaera Wing if you do not have
one. Also bring a couple Medicinal Herbs and a couple Antidotal Herbs just in
case. Leave the town.



<<----------------------------xii. RA'S MIRROR [WK12]------------------------->>


From Moonahan, step on the bridge. From the bridge, take 3 steps east, 3 steps
south and head west to get out of Badboon territory. These monsters are pretty
tough right now. Keep heading west through the forest. Do not go south until you
hit sand because there are more Badboons and Dragonfries there.

Once you hit the sand, go south and you should see a Castle surrounded by a
Poisonous Swamp. This is Moonbrooke Castle, the Castle that was sacked when the
game began. You could check this place out now, but I do not suggest it.

Instead, head back east, but this time stay south of the water. You should see a
couple bridges followed by a sparkle on a Poisonous Swamp. Search the sparkle
for RA'S MIRROR. Use your Chimaera Wing and return to Moonahan.

Find the dog in this town and approach it. Press Y to bring up the Menu and use
Ra's Mirror. The Mirror will be destroyed and the curse on the dog will be
lifted.

The dog transforms into the Princess of Moonbrooke. So THAT is what happened to
her. She will join you, which will complete your party line-up. She starts at
level 1 with the Midheal spell. Be sure to buy her a Divine Dagger. If you saved
the Seed of Agility and the Seed of Life for her, use them on her now.

Note : Inn prices will now be 3 times what it was when the Hero was alone, and
       1.5 times what it was before the Princess joined.

\______________________________________________________________________________/



<<----------------------------xiii. GRIND 3 [WK13]---------------------------->>


Your Princess is weak. She needs some levels. I recommend grinding around the
bridge just a few steps south of Moonahan. You may want to defend often with
her. Use Moonahan to rest, restock and save.

The area east of Moonahan has some new monsters. Badboons have high attack
power. Dragonfries can cast Sizz. Both types of monsters can easily kill a party
member if they gain up on one or if they get the jump on you. Be careful and
keep your HP high. If anybody dies, return to Moonahan immediately. Also, Smogs
can cast Fizzle on your party, but they are no big deal.

At level 8 the Prince learns Fizzle. Fizzle has a chance of preventing a group
of monsters from casting spells and costs 3 MP.

At level 2 the Princess learns Snooze, which has a chance of putting a group of
monsters to sleep and costs 2 MP. I strongly recommend using Snooze if you meet
up with 2 or 3 Badboons in a battle.

At level 4 the Princess learns Woosh. Woosh hits a group of monsters and is
generally stronger than Sizz, but it costs 4 MP to use. Since you are next to
Moonahan anyway, feel free to abuse this new spell.

Once the Princess is level 5 and you've earned 1302G, return to Moonahan and
sell the Hero's Chain Sickle for 247G. You should have 1549G, enough for a Steel
Broadsword, a Chimaera Wing (if you need one) and a stay at the Inn. Equip your
new weapon on the Hero.



<<----------------------xiv. MOONBROOKE (OPTIONAL) [WK14]--------------------->>


Visiting Moonbrooke is entirely optional and has no treasure. Like Erdrick's
Cave in the original Dragon Quest, Moonbrooke is there to add to the story.
Also, if you are new to the game, you can get some useful information on what to
do and where to go next.

Make sure you have a Chimaera Wing in your inventory, then cross the bridge
south of Moonahan and head west to Moonbrooke.

The monsters here are the same ones you met up with before. Corpse Corporals can
cast Dazzle on your party, which makes your physical attacks inaccurate. You
could have met up with one south of Moonahan but they are much more common here.

Go north and talk to the flame. I am guessing it is the spirit of the former
King and the Princess's father. This is how you were supposed to know the
Princess was the dog.

The Treasure Chests here contain nothing.

To get to the inner courtyard and the stairs, go just outside the perimeter in
the northwestern part of the Castle and head south, hugging the Castle wall.
When you get to the southwestern corner, head northeast to the courtyeard and
head down the stairs.

Talk to the fallen guard and he will turn into a flame. Talk to him again and
the flame will disappear. Yeah, this was the clue as to what to do with Ra's
Mirror.

This is all you can do here. Leave Moonbrooke and either walk or use a Chimaera
Wing to return to Moonahan.



<<-------------------------xv. PILLAR OF WINDS [WK15]------------------------->>


At level 10 the Prince learns Zoom. At a cost of 1 MP, it will teleport you to
any town you have already been in. In the NES version, the spell Return would
return you to the place you last saved. But in the Switch/Mobile versions, you
can select your town of choice.

Rest at the Inn and make sure you have a Chimaera Wing and a few Medicinal or
Antidotal Herbs. If you cannot afford an Iron Lance for the Prince, do not
worry. The upcoming tower is the first real dungeon of the game, but it is not
that difficult.

I suggest you save your Sizz and Woosh spells for groups of 3 or more monsters
during the next journey.

Head northwest of Moonahan through the forest. Ignore the first bridge and
continue north. Cross the next bridge and start heading south along the coast.
When you get to a river, cross the first bridge you see and continue south.
Cross three more bridges and head west to the Pillar of Winds.



Floor 1F


You will come across a new monster in this tower. Dirty Rats can call other
Dirty Rats to battle.

Head south past the stairs until you see a Treasure Chest. Open it for a
MEDICINAL HERB. Return to the stairs and this time head east and north to more
stairs.



Floor 2F


Be very careful. If you fall off the tower, you will have to start over from
Floor 1F. Quick Save is useful at a time like this.

Talk to the soldier if you want, then head west to go up another flight of
stairs.



Floor 3F


Head south and get the Treasure Chest. It contains ~321G. Head up the stairs to
the south.



Floor 4F


On this floor and the floors above you can run into Killipedes. They have good
resilience and can hit you with a grievous attack, the monster version of a
critical hit.

I suggest tapping on the directional pad to keep yourself from falling off. Take
2 steps south, then head east and ascend the first stairs you see.



Floor 5F


Head west and north, being very careful as you turn the corner. Head down the
stairs.



Floor 4F


Head down the stairs next to you.



Floor 3F


Head down the stairs next to you.



Floor 2F


Press A next to the item to receive a WINDBRAKER. This accessory will move you
an extra two squares if you fall off a tower. The direction you move depends on
which direction you fall off. Now go back to the southern part of Floor 4F.



Floor 4F


Head east and up the stairs.



Floor 5F


Tap the directional pad once to go east 1 square, then head north to the stairs.



Floor 6F


Head to the northwestern stairs.



Floor 7F


Take the stairs next to you.



Floor 8F


Open the Chest to receive a PRAYER RING. It restores your MP but breaks after a
few uses. I recommend putting it in a Vault to save it for the end of the game.
If you still have HP and MP left, you can grind for a bit on the top floor. Once
you are completely drained, go back down the steps.



Floor 7F


Go north one step to fall off the tower. You are done with the Pillar of Winds.



<<-------------------------xvi. DRAGON'S HORN [WK16]-------------------------->>


Walk, Zoom or use a Chimaera Wing to get back to Moonahan to rest, restock and
save. Grab the Iron Lance for the Prince from the Equipment Shop and sell his
Chain Sickle if you have not already done so. Buy the Full Plate Armour and
Steel Shield for the Hero and sell his Chain Mail and Leather Shield. If you do
not have the gold, go to the hills south of Moonahan and grind there until you
do.

At level 8 the Princess learns Holy Protection. It works like a Holy Water,
removing weak encounters for a number of steps.

The next journey is a bit long but you should be fine. Make sure you bring your
Windbraker along.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
\______________________________________________________________________________/


From Moonahan, cross the bridge and head west towards Moonbrooke. Cross the
bridge west of Moonbrooke and enter the Shrine, which I'll call the Moonbrooke
Shrine.

In the Moonbrooke Shrine is a House of Worship. As you cross the bridge a "!"
will appear above your head. That is because there is a hidden door in the
blackness. Unfortunately you do not have the right key. Exit via the western
stairs.

In this area you can run into Chewlips. Watch out for their Sickly-Sweet Breath
which can put your party to sleep. Since that move is an ability and not a
spell, they can use it an unlimited amount of times.

The Prince learns Evac at level 14 and the Princess learns Kasap at level 10. If
you are in a dungeon or tower, you can warp to the entrance using Evac at a cost
of 6 MP. Kasap lowers the defense of a group of monsters at a cost of 2 MP.

Continue west until you see a desert. Cross northwest through the desert past an
oasis and you should see hills. Continue northwest past the hills and you should
eventually see two towers. These towers are known as the Dragon's Horns. Enter
the south tower.



DRAGON'S HORNS (SOUTH TOWER)


Note : During my playthrough, I was on a floor. I walked to the hole in the
       middle. As I stepped on the hole, I got a battle encounter. The battle
       screen appeared, faded, then re-appeared. I finished the battle like
       normal. When it was over, I was back on the first floor. It's just a
       weird thing that happened that I thought I should mention.

This tower is easy to navigate. Just keep circling the tower and don't fall in
the hole in the middle.

On Floor 4 and the floors above you can meet a couple of new monsters. Madusae
can cast Snooze and Kasap. Shamans can Fizzle your party.

Once you get to Floor 7, talk to the soldier if you want. Make sure someone in
your party has the Windbraker. Fall off the tower in the northern direction. Be
careful not to fall off on the western side.

If you did it right, you should be on the north side of the river between the
Horns.

Head northwest where the Equipment Shop and Item Shop is. You should be able to
see two monsters next to a lady. Don't go west of the Shops' entrances. Instead,
go south to the Item Shop and buy Banishing Bells for everybody. Banishing Bells
gives your party members more resistance to Snooze and Fizzle. Equip them.

If you have 1508G left, sell the Prince's Chain Mail and buy him a Cloak of
Evasion. If not, do not worry about it right now.

Quick Save. Now approach the monsters for a battle.

Once the battle is over, you will be taken to see her grandfather. As a token of
gratitude he will let you borrow his Ship. Also, he suggests you visit Tantegel
to the east. Get in the Ship.

If you have the Silver Key, open the door to the south. The guy there will give
you a reward if you find his Sunken Treasure. Now head north and east along the
narrow waterway here and you will find yourself outside of Rippleport with the
Ship.

In the sea you will find Man o' Wars, Merluscs and Hawk Men. Man o' War has a
chance of putting someone to sleep with its attacks. Merluscs can use
Sickly-Sweet breath an unlimited number of times to potentially put your party
to sleep. Hawk Men hit hard with their attacks and can Heal, so be sure to keep
your HP high.



<<---------------------------xviii. TANTEGEL [WK18]--------------------------->>


The land to the east of Rippleport is Alefgard, the country from the first game.
You can disembark on Alefgard and walk east to Tantegel if you want. However, I
suggest you stay in the sea because the monsters there give better amounts of
gold.

Follow the coast of Alefgard south, then east. Pass the bridge to your north,
then follow the water north where it goes inland. When you get to a fork in the
water, go northwest. The southern castle is the Dragonlord's Castle and the
northern castle is Tantegel.

Anyway, enter Tantegel.

Note : You must have the Silver Key to access the Draper's Shop.

Welcome to Tantegel. See the green guy to the west? Talk to that guy and he will
ask you about the Sunken Treasure. Answer "Yes" to his question. Talk to him
again and this time answer "No." This trigger should make a sparkle appear north
of Rippleport, showing you the location of the Sunken Treasure.

There is an old man next to a pot. Talk to this guy if you are Cursed and he
will remove it. Search the pot for a HOLY WATER.

If you have the Silver Key, enter the shop to the north. This is the Draper's
Shop. The lady here will ask if you are looking for the Celestial Skein, an item
which you need to make an excellent armour. She suggests that you look in the
North Tower of the Dragon's Horns. This trigger should make a sparkle appear in
the North Tower so you can easily find it.

Leave Tantegel and Zoom to Rippleport.


<<----------------------xix. ECHO FLUTE (OPTIONAL) [WK19]--------------------->>


Note: You need the Silver Key to do this part.

Enter the town and talk to the grandfather again to get the Ship.

Sail directly north of Rippleport. After a while you should see a sparkle in the
water. Search the spot to get the SUNKEN TREASURE. You can Zoom back to
Rippleport but I prefer sailing back for the EXP and gold.

Enter Rippleport and go to where the Grimlins were. Search the northwestern spot
here for a SEED OF STRENGTH. Once you have used it, talk to the grandfather
again. Head south with the Ship and use the Silver Key on the door. Give the guy
the Sunken Treasure and he will give you the ECHO FLUTE. Use the Echo Flute in a
particular location, and there will be an echo if there is a certain type of
item nearby.

If you know this game or if you are following this walkthrough, you do not need
the Echo Flute. I suggest you put the Windbraker and the Echo Flute in the Vault
to get a couple more spaces for items.



<<--------------------xx. CELESTIAL SKEIN (OPTIONAL) [WK20]------------------->>


Exit Rippleport with the Ship. Head south and west to the Dragon's Horns. Enter
the North Tower.

Go up two flights of stairs and you should see a sparkle. Examine it to find the
CELESTIAL SKEIN. Walk or Evac out.



<<-----------------xxi. DRAGONLORD'S CASTLE (OPTIONAL) [WK21]----------------->>


Zoom or sail to Tantegel. If you have 1783G, sell the Princess's Plain Clothes
and buy a Cloak of Evasion for her, leaving you enough gold for a stay at the
Inn. If not, sail around Tantegel or grind in the hills north of Rippleport
until you have it. Grab a few Medicinal Herbs from the Item Shop if you wish.
Bring your Silver Key if you have it.

\______________________________________________________________________________/


Use the Ship and cross the water to get to the southern castle. This is the
Dragonlord's Castle, the final area of the first game.

Enter the Dragonlord's Castle. Head north and down the stairs.



Floor B1


On this floor are some new monsters. Sabrecats have low HP but have a chance of
attacking twice. Dragonflies can breathe fire on your party. Goregons have high
resilience and can cast Dazzle on your party. Cobra Kaisers have a chance of
poisoning you with their attacks. Mummy Boys do not do much other than attack,
and you have already met the Gremlins.

Follow the linear path to the stairs.



Floor B2


Follow another linear path to the stairs.



Floor B3


Walk counter-clockwise and go down either stairs you want. Both paths lead to
Floor B4.



Floor B4


Go up the ascending stairs in the middle of the room. Go up two more flights of
stairs and down a flight.



Floor B3



You should be in the centre of this room next to a Chest. Open it to get
ERDRICK'S SWORD. Give it to either the Hero or the Prince. My suggestion would
be the Prince.

If you are running low on HP, MP and supplies, you can Evac out now and go to
Tantegel to rest and restock. You are going to need some MP for healing in the
next part coming up and a few Medicinal Herbs could be useful. Either way, find
your way back to floor B4.



Floor B4


This time, go down the descending stairs in the middle of the room.



Floor B5


Follow the path south, west, then north to more stairs.



Floor B6


Head east and down the stairs.



Floor B7


There are no encounters on this floor.

Head north, west, then follow the narrow path north, east, south and finally
west. Talk to the Dragonlord.

Oh. It is the great, great grandson. Answer "Yes" to his question. He tells you
that you need to collect five Sigils and take them to an island south of where
Cantlin used to be.

Note : You must have the Silver Key to do the next part.

Head back towards the entrance of this room. Make sure you have Medicinal Herbs
and MP for healing. See those diagonally-striped blue-and-white squares? These
are what I call Damage Tiles. Each party member will lose 14 HP a step if they
step on these tiles.

Head north from the entrance into the Damage Tiles. Heal your party every two
steps you take. When you get to the northern side, use your Silver Key on the
door. Open the Treasure Chests for ~156G, ~983G, SEED OF STRENGTH, and some FULL
PLATE ARMOUR. Evac out and return to Tantegel.



<<--------------------------xxii. SHIP SAILING [WK22]------------------------->>


Sell the Full Plate Armour if you did the Dragonlord's Castle. Also, if you gave
the Erdrick's Sword to the Prince as suggested, sell his Iron Lance.

If you can afford it, buy a Wizard's Staff for 4000G, give it to the Princess
and sell her Divine Dagger. The Wizard's Staff, if used as an item in battle,
can shoot flames dealing damage to a group of monsters. It does about the same
damage as a Sizz spell, but costs no MP to use and can be used even when
Fizzled. Abuse it as much as you want.

The next part includes quite a bit of sailing, so make sure you are healed up to
full and bring some Medicinal Herbs just in case.

Zoom to Midenhall and start sailing southwest. You might meet a new monster.
Gargoyles can cast Fizzle and have a strong physical attack, but give good
experience.

Follow the coast south until the coast turns east. Press X to access your map.
See that flashing square directly south of you? This is the Shrine of Rubiss.
But you do not need to go there until you have all the Sigils. Instead, head to
the island southeast of this Shrine.

From the Shrine of Rubiss, head south until you get to the island. Take the
river into the interior of the island and enter the Castle. This is the Castle
of Dirkandor. Once you enter, immediately exit the Castle and return to the
Ship. Now that you have entered the town once, you can Zoom back here anytime
you want.

Press X to view your map. The square southwest of you is a cave you cannot enter
yet. Ignore it for now and continue south to another square. This is the Fire
Shrine.

Enter the Fire Shrine and you should see a sparkle to the northeast. Search the
sparkle to get the SUN SIGIL. One down, four to go. Exit the Fire Shrine.

Note : The Sun Sigil is not in your item list. Instead, a symbol representing
       the Sigil appears on every characters' status screens.

From the Fire Shrine, sail west and a bit south to find an island with some
trees in the middle, which I will call Yggdrasil Island. Search the trees to
find a YGGDRASIL LEAF. This leaf can be used to revive a dead party member to
maximum HP. However, note that you can only hold one at a time.

West of this island is a peninsula. Follow the southern coast west until you
come across a town. Enter and exit. Now you have the Zoom point for Burrowell.

Note : If you use your Yggdrasil Leaf, Zoom to Burrowell, sail east to Yggdrasil
       Island and grab another.

Sail east and a bit south until you are south of Yggdrasil Island. Go about 10
steps south of the island, then sail directly east. You should soon find a
couple of islands with a town next to a Shrine. Enter the town.

Head northeast and talk to the dog. He moves and a sparkle appears. Search the
sparkle to get the GOLD KEY. Leave town and Zoom to Burrowell.



<<----------------------------xxiii. BURROWELL [WK23]------------------------->>


Use your Gold Key on the door in Burrowell and head down the stairs to find the
rest of the town.

Make sure you have at least 2000G, then head to the western Item Shop. Select
the ???. The merchant will ask if you can pay for it. Choose "Yes" and 2000G
will be deducted from your gold. Check your Items. You should have the JAILOR'S
KEY in your possession.

Next, head to the house directly north of the western Item Shop. Talk to the guy
to learn about Don Calico, a master weaver who lives in a town called Slewse. He
can make an excellent armour for you if you give him the proper materials.

Last, go to the building north of the House of Worship. You can enter it if you
go east as if you are going through a wall. Talk to the soldier to learn that
Roge Fastfinger, a thief, seems to have escaped his Jail cell. Talk to the guy
in the western cell to learn that Hargon lies beyond a territory called
Rendarak.

Open the eastern cell door. From the northeasternmost square, go south 1 step,
then east 1 step. You will find Roge Fastfinger. Talk to him and he will give
you the FLOODGATE KEY.

Forget about buying an Iron Helmet. You get a better one coming up soon. The
rest of the equipment here is probably too expensive for you right now. Once you
are ready, Zoom back to Midenhall.



<<---------------------xxiv. MIDENHALL 2 (OPTIONAL) [WK24]-------------------->>


Enter the room to the east, then head south to the Treasure Chests. They contain
SEED OF LIFE, MEDICINAL HERB, ~1146G, SEED OF STRENGTH, SEED OF MAGIC and the
MARK OF ERDRICK. The Mark of Erdrick can be used to obtain a helmet later in the
game.

Note : You need the Silver Key for the next part.

Go back into the building but this time, use your Silver Key on the door and
head north to the Jail.

Unlock the northern cell and the guy will tell you the King of Alefgard has the
Soul Sigil. Unlock the door to the south. Make sure you are fully healed on HP
and MP. Go south 2 steps, unlock the southern cell door and walk all the way
west. Each party member will receive 28 damage, so heal them back up. Look south
and press A to find a SEED OF AGILITY. Press Y to use the Menu instead of A
because you don't want to talk to the guy until you use your Seed.

Once you use it, make sure the Hero has some Medicinal Herbs on him. Quick Save
and talk to the guy. Oh wait... it's a monster!

| This battle may take several tries. Attack with the Hero, defend with the    |
| Prince and cast Dazzle with the Princess on the first turn. I would not use  |
| the Fizzle spell on him. The reason is because he has a buff and a debuff    |
| spell which do no damage to your party. In this battle, you need this monster|
| to waste turns casting these spells. If the Wrecktor is Fizzled, it will stop|
| trying to cast these spells and start using physical attacks, which hit hard.|
|                                                                              |
| During the next few turns, have the Hero attack, the Prince healing or       |
| defending and the Princess healing or defending. The Hero may have to use    |
| some Medicinal Herbs if the monster uses Kaboom. If you can get away with    |
| casting a Kasap, go for it. Keep trying, and with a combination of strategy  |
| and dumb luck, it should eventually go down.                                 |
|                                                                              |

| Note : As there are no other monsters aiding the Wrecktor, he will not cast  |
|        Kazing.                                                               |

\______________________________________________________________________________/


If used as an item in battle, the Lightning Staff is generally more powerful
than the Wizard's Staff. It hits a group of monsters. I suggest equipping the
Lightning Staff on the Princess and giving the Wizard's Staff to the Prince.
Keep Erdrick's Sword equipped on the Prince if you chose to do so earlier; in
that situation, the Wizard's Staff is to be used only as an item in battle. If
the Hero has Erdrick's Sword, equip the Wizard's Staff on the Prince.

Heal up, then walk through the damage tiles and up the stairs. Rest at the Inn
if you want, then leave town.



<<--------------------------xxv. ODDS AND ENDS [WK25]------------------------->>


Zoom to Cannock and enter. Open the gold-rimmed door with your Gold Key and open
the Treasure Chest to receive ERDRICK'S SHIELD. Only the Hero can equip it, so
go ahead and do that. Sell the Steel Shield.

Zoom to Moonahan and enter. Find a small building with a gold-rimmed door just
southwest of the House of Worship. Use your Gold Key on the door and go
downstairs.

Down here, Quick Save, then use your Jailor's Key on the door and walk north for
a battle with 2 Grimlins. They can cast Midheal, Fizzle, Sizzle and Call other
Grimlins. Just use your physical attacks and they will go down.

Once you have defeated the Grimlins, a sparkle will appear in the northeast
corner. Search it to get the WATER SIGIL. Two down, three to go.

Zoom to Tantegel and enter. Head west to the Equipment Shop and head upstairs.
Use your Gold Key on the door and talk to the King. He will give you the SOUL
SIGIL. Three down, two to go.

Make sure you have on you the Mark of Erdrick. Sail south of Tantegel, then
follow the water southeast and south. You should see a Shrine to the east. This
is the Holy Sanctum from the original game. Enter.

Talk to the guy while holding the Mark of Erdrick and he will recognize your
party as Erdrick's descendants. He will step to the side, allowing you to grab
ERDRICK'S HELM. Only the Hero can equip it, so go ahead and do that.

Zoom to Zahan. Make sure everybody is fully healed. Step into the damage tiles
while keeping an eye on your HP. You want to head to the Jail door to the west.
Open the door with your Jailor's Key and open the Treasure Chest to receive the
SUBTLE SHUTTLE. Now you have the two items that Don Calico needs. However we
still need to find his hometown, Slewse.

Rest up at the Inn. Now go into the Damage Tiles again, this time going to the
eastern room. Open the Jail door to access a Chest that contains a PRAYER RING.

Zoom to Burrowell and get into your Ship. Follow the coast northwest past the
impassable mountains. Once you are past that, ignore the first river you see.
Take the next river (the one close to a bridge) north to the northwest tip.

Around this area you will encounter some new monsters that may be a little
difficult for your levels and current equipment. Headhunters have decent attack.
Magic Marionettes can lower your MP. Brainy Badboons can cast Dazzle and Kasap.
Miasmas can cast Snooze and Dazzle.

Head west and north past the small Poisonous Swamp. Head east through the hills
and you should soon see a town. Go around the mountains and enter the town.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
\______________________________________________________________________________/


Welcome to Slewse! Make sure you have the Celestial Skein and the Subtle Shuttle
on you. Head northwest to a building with a gold-rimmed door. Use your Gold Key
on the door and head down the stairs. Talk to the guy. You have found Don
Calico! Since you already have the items he is looking for, he will take them
off your hands.

Note : Without the Silver Key, you cannot trigger the sparkle in the Dragon's
       Horn North Tower, which makes the Celestial Skein difficult to locate.

Now you must save normally, reset the game and go back into your file. Slewse
does not have a Save Point, so you need to Zoom to a town that does. Once you
have reloaded your file, Zoom back to Slewse and head back to Don Calico. Your
new armour should be ready. For your efforts, you receive a FLOWING DRESS. I
suggest equipping it on the Princess, but the Hero and the Prince are also able
to wear it.

If you have at least 3300G, sell the Prince's Cloak of Evasion as well as the
one the Princess was wearing (if you equipped her with the Flowing Dress) for
2700G and buy a Magic Armour for the Prince. It lowers any Magic damage you
receive by 25%. You can get a free Magic Armour for the Hero a little later. If
you don't have the gold, try grinding outside of Slewse. If the monsters around
there are too difficult, Zoom to Tantegel and grind in the water or inside the
Dragonlord's Castle.

Head to the Item shop east of the Inn. Hug the wall of the Item Shop as you head
north, then head west until you are northwest of the Inn. Use your Jailor's Key
on the door to the building here and head downstairs.

Take 1 step east and use your Floodgate Key. You have to go into your Item Menu
in order to use it. With that, the Floodgates are opened, giving you better
access to Slewse from the sea. Also, you now have access to the Tower of the
Moon to the south of Slewse. I recommend you take care of other business first
as the Tower is difficult at your current levels and with your current
equipment.

Instead, Zoom to Dirkandor.



<<---------------------------xxvii. DIRKANDOR [WK27]-------------------------->>


Around Dirkandor you can find Hawk Men, Metal Slimes, Sorcerers, Walking
Corpses, Miasmas and Treevils. Treevils can lower your MP and cast Fizzle,
Sorcerers can cast Fizzle, Kabuff and Sizzle, Miasmas can Snooze and Dazzle you.
Metal Slimes have 100% resistance to all spells and have a high resilience, but
they give you plenty of experience if you are lucky enough to kill one.

Go north, ignoring the first past west. Follow the second path west and south.
Use your Gold Key on the door. Open the Treasure Chests next to the Equipment
Shop merchant to receive a TECTONIC PLATE and a DIVINE DAGGER. Equip the
Tectonic Plate. Backtrack to where you ignored the first path going west. Go
that way. Talk to the King between the two bunny girls. Answer "Yes" to his
question. After the talk, walk south to the centre of the Coliseum.

You will face off against a Striking Sabrecat. I don't consider this monster a
mini-boss. I suggest using physical attacks with the Hero and the Prince and
have the Princess use Kasap on the first turn. The Striking Sabrecat should go
down during the second turn.

Talk to the King again to receive the MOON SIGIL. Four down, only one to go. The
King becomes a Save Point. Now you can explore the rest of the town.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
\______________________________________________________________________________/


After all that, it's time to do another Tower and gain some gold and experience.
The Lighthouse is on an island south of Tantegel. With your new equipment, the
Lighthouse should be easy. Use your map to locate it. When you are ready, start
sailing south to the island and enter the Lighthouse.

Talk to the guard if you want, then head up the stairs and inside the Tower.



Floor 1F


In this Tower are a couple of new monsters. Deadnauts do nothing special. Orc
Chieftains can cast Heal. Nothing you cannot handle.

Head east and north. Ignore the first path leading west and take the second.
Head north through the opening in the wall and continue west to the northwestern
corner, ignoring another path south. From the corner, head south, ignoring all
paths east until you reach the southwestern corner.

See that building to the northeast? Walk to the east side of the building and go
north until you are about 5 steps away from the northeast corner of the
building. Walk west into the side of the building. Exit through the northern
side to a Treasure Chest that contains ~560G.

From here head south past a room with stairs to another room with stairs. Take
these stairs up to the next level.



Floor 2F


Head south and ascend a flight of stairs.



Floor 3F


Head east and ascend another flight of stairs.



Floor 4F


Head north and ascend yet another flight of stairs.



Floor 5F


Grab the Treasure Chest here. It contains a CHAIN SICKLE. Backtrack to Floor 1F.



Floor 1F


From here, head 1 room west and ascend the stairs.



Floor 2F


Follow the path west and south to the stairs.



Floor 3F


Passing by the stairs, head into the wall to the north to ascend five flights of
stairs.



Floor 8F


Talk to the soldier to learn more about Rendarak. Other than that, there is
nothing here. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



Floor 3F


Head south and west to ascend the stairs you passed earlier.



Floor 4F


Head south into the wall and grab the Treasure Chest. It contains ~706G. Head up
the nearby stairs.



Floor 5F


Head east into the wall and up the stairs.



Floor 6F


Head north and descend the next stairs.



Floor 5F


Finally, head west to a Treasure Chest to receive a SEED OF LIFE. Backtrack to
Floor 4F.



Floor 4F


Head east and north. Ignore the eastern stairs. Instead, take the western
stairs. Be careful not to fall off the Tower. Use Quick Save if you wish.



Floor 5F


Head east to the stairs. You can walk over the rock.



Floor 6F


Use your Gold Key on the door, then go to the northwestern stairs.



Floor 7F


Head east. You should see a Gremlin going south into the wall. Do that now. Talk
to the old man. Follow him wherever he goes. Quick Save often and be careful
about falling off the Tower. The old man will lead you down five flights of
stairs.



Floor 2F


Talk to the old man, then attempt to open the Treasure Chest. There is nothing
inside... wait a second. It's a trap!

Four Gremlins will attack you, but they should be easy at this point.

For defeating them, you get the STAR SIGIL. That should be all five. However,
there is one more item you need to open the Cave to Rendarak. Actually, it's two
items because you need one to get the other one. Now you can cast Evac to get
out of here.



<<------------------------------xxix. GRIND 4 [WK29]-------------------------->>


The Tower of the Moon is the next area you need to go to, but it is difficult
for your current levels. I recommend you do a grinding session here. If you
choose to grind near Dirkandor, you can fight Metal Slimes. Or you can Zoom to
Slewse and fight some tougher monsters around town or the first floor of the
Tower of the Moon south of town. My recommendation is that you do the latter, as
you need gold.

Earn 16000G. Zoom to Burrowell and buy an Aurora Blade for the Hero. If you
choose to use it as an item in battle, it will cast Dazzle on a group of
monsters. Up until now, in my playthrough, my Hero had been using the Steel
Broadsword I got WAY back in Moonahan.

Now earn 21500G and Zoom to Slewse or Burrowell to buy a Power Shield for the
Prince. Equip it and sell his Leather Shield. If you use the Power Shield in
battle, it will cast Midheal on the party member that has it, giving you a free
heal. Eventually you may want to get Power Shields for everybody.

I recommend getting the Hero to level 28, the Prince to level 26 and the
Princess to level 21. At level 25 the Prince learns Kabuff which raises the
party's physical defense. At level 21 the Princess learns Kaboom, which hits all
monsters on the screen regardless of grouping for a nice amount of damage at a
cost of 8 MP.

If you can afford it, get a second Power Shield and give it to the Hero but do
not equip it, as Erdrick's Shield has more defense. Instead, use it in battle to
restore your HP. If you cannot afford it yet, do not worry about it.

You should be good enough to do the next area of the game, the Tower of the
Moon. From Slewse, head south and use the Ship to cross the river to the Tower.



<<------------------------xxx. TOWER OF THE MOON [WK30]----------------------->>


The Tower of the Moon has some of the toughest monsters you have seen yet.
Heyedras. Terrordactyls have a chance of attacking twice. Watch out for
Whackolytes that can cast Kasap, Kabuff and Sizzle.



Floor 1F


Head west to the Treasure Chest to receive a SEED OF STRENGTH. Ascend the nearby
stairs.



Floor 2F


Make your way to the Treasure Chest to your east. It contains a SEED OF MAGIC.
Ascend the western stairs.



Floor 3F


Open the Treasure Chest for ~1278G. Head back down the stairs.



Floor 2F


Go southeast and down the stairs you see here.



Floor 1F


Open the Treasure Chest for a SEED OF RESILIENCE. Go back upstairs.



Floor 2F


Head northwest and ascend the stairs in the middle here.



Floor 3F


Head north and go up the stairs.



Floor 4F


Head south to the Treasure Chests where you will get ~243G and another SEED OF
RESILIENCE. Head northeast to the stairs.



Floor 5F


Ascend the stairs directly to the southwest.



Floor 6F


Head to the next stairs. Be careful not to fall off the edge.



Floor 7F


Collect the PRAYER RING from the Treasure Chest, then backtrack to Floor 5F
where you saw the doors.



Floor 5F


Open one of the doors and head down four flights of stairs.



Floor 1F


Talk to the guy if you want, then open the Chest to receive the MOONSHARD, the
main item you are looking for in this Tower. Evac out or stay for a bit if you
want to grind some experience and gold.



<<---------------------------xxxi. SEA CAVE [WK31]---------------------------->>


If you can afford it, Zoom to Burrowell or Slewse and get the second Power
Shield for the Hero so he can heal in battle. In any case, Zoom to Dirkandor and
rest at the Inn.

Leave Dirkandor and press X to view your map. The Sea Cave is the next dungeon.
It's the purple flashing square just to your southwest. Sail there and head to
the southern side. Position yourself 3 squares south of the entrance. Use the
Moonshard in this spot. The shoals surrounding the cave will disappear. Enter
the cave.



Floor B1


Holy lava! Stepping on the lava will damage you by 1 HP per step. Use Safe
Passage so that the lava does not damage you.

Head west and north through the lava. Head east and pick up the ~1188G in the
Chest. Return to the dungeon entrance.

This time, head south and take the first path you see going west. Ignore the
darkened room and continue west and north to a Chest. It contains a SEED OF
MAGIC.

Head south and to the stairs.



Floor B2


The dark room to the south contains a Chest. IT'S A TRAP! Upon opening this
Chest, the Hero will be poisoned, so ignore this Chest.

Instead, start heading west of this room. Head south through the opening, then
head west where you should see a lava-filled path heading north. Head south from
this path and make your way to the darkened room to the southeast. Head north to
the Chest to receive a PRAYER RING.

Backtrack to the lava-filled path heading north and follow it to the stairs.



Floor B3


Use your Gold Key to open the door. As you head west, ignore the first Chest you
see (it's a trap) and open the next one. You get a SEED OF STRENGTH.

Head south into the darkness. Circle around the wall to get to the Chest. It
contains a MAGIC ARMOUR. I suggest you equip it on the Hero. Although it has 5
less defense than the Tectonic Plate, the Magic Armour lowers any magic damage
the Hero may take.

South of this Chest you should see some stairs in a corner. 4 squares east of
these stairs are the stairs you want to take.



Floor B4


Cast Safe Passage and head northwest through the lava to some stairs.



Floor B5


Head south and east. You should be able to see a monster. Heal up to max, then
talk to the monster for a battle. Actually, two of them. Oh, they are
Whackolytes. No problem. A quick Kaboom will take care of them. Continue north
and grab the FALSE IDOL.

If you do not have the 21500G yet for the second Power Shield (for the Hero), I
suggest grinding on this floor until you do. Also, I recommend you get the Hero
to level 30, the Prince to level 28 and the Princess to level 23.

Once you are done, you can Evac out of the Sea Cave.



<<------------------------xxxii. SHRINE OF RUBISS [WK32]---------------------->>


You should now have the False Idol and all five Sigils. Your next destination is
the Shrine of Rubiss, northwest of Dirkandor. Sail or Zoom to Dirkandor. From
the mouth of the river, sail directly north to the Shrine.

In here, go down six flights of stairs to the bottom floor. Walk 4 steps north
to trigger a message. Read the dialogue, then check your Items. The Eye of
Rubiss should be in your possession. Leave the Shrine.



<<---------------------------xxxiii. BERAN [WK33]----------------------------->>


Note : You need a Yggdrasil Leaf for the next part. To get one, Zoom to
       Burrowell, sail east to Yggdrasil Island and search the trees in the
       middle. Be aware that you can only hold 1 at a time.

If you have been following this walkthrough, there should be one town that you
have yet to explore. You can choose to get there by land or by sea. Both routes
take roughly the same time.



Land Route


Zoom to Cannock and start walking west to Gwaelin's Gate. Use your Gold Key on
the door here and take the Teleportal to another Shrine, which I will call the
Beran Shrine. Ignore the other two Teleportals and leave this Shrine.

Start heading southeast. When you get to the water, continue east through the
hills. Cross the bridge, then cross another bridge to the south. From the
bridge, head southwest until you find the town. Enter the town.




Sea Route


Zoom to Zahan and start sailing east. Keep an eye on your map. After a while,
you should appear at the southwestern corner of the map. The town you are
looking for is the flashing orange square northeast of you. Head there. Dock on
the coast and enter the town.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
\______________________________________________________________________________/


Welcome to Beran! If you have not already done so, buy the second Power Shield
and give it to the Hero (but keep Erdrick's Shield equipped). Store the Tectonic
Plate and the Moonshard in the Vault.

Make sure you have your Yggdrasil Leaf, then rest at the Inn.

When you wake up, the Prince will be sick. He will tell you to leave him behind
and continue on to Hargon. Screw that. Stand 1 step north of the Prince in the
bed, face south, then press Y to access the Menu. Use the Yggdrasil Leaf and
select the Prince to administer the cure. He will rejoin your party. This is the
only Inn rest in the game where you have to do this. Leave town.

Zoom to Burrowell and sail east to Yggdrasil Island to grab another Yggdrasil
Leaf.

\______________________________________________________________________________/


Make sure you are equipped as listed above. The next dungeon is the most
difficult in the game but you should be able to handle it now. Also, if you have
any Prayer Rings in your Vault, now is the time to bring them and, if necessary,
use them.

From the Inn in Beran, head northeast. Use your Jailor's Key on the door, cast
Safe Passage and walk north through the Teleportal. Head upstairs to talk to the
guy if you want. Go one square south of the Teleportal, then head south to exit
the place. The Gremlin to the northwest has nothing important to say.

Head west a bit and talk to the flame. If you do not have the Eye of Rubiss, the
flame will not let you through. But since you do, it will disappear, giving you
partial access to the Cave to Rendarak, but you have to do one more thing.

Head to the northern part of the Poisonous Swamp. Go 4 steps west into the
Swamp. Now face north. Use the False Idol in this spot and the Cave to Rendarak
will open up for you. Enter the cave.



<<-----------------------xxxv. CAVE TO RENDARAK 1 [WK35]---------------------->>


Quick Save. There are collapsible floors in this cave. If you fall to the next
floor by accident, reset and reload your Quick Save.



Floor 1F


Make your way to the stairs just to the east of you.



Floor B1


Grab the SEED OF STRENGTH to the southeast. Now head north to a different flight
of stairs.



Floor 1F


Go directly east to the wall, then south to ascend the stairs.



Floor 2F


Start heading east. Ignore the first two intersections. At the third
intersection, head north and climb the stairs.



Floor 3F


Start heading southeast and ignore the dark room to the west. The Chest you see
here contains a TOMBOLA TICKET. Continue east to the stairs.



Floor 4F


WARNING : Heal up to max and Quick Save here. Green Dragons roam Floor 5F. If
          you get jumped by 4 of them and they all use Fire Breath, you could be
          in BIG trouble. However, if you manage to defeat them, they give
          really good experience.

Head up the stairs and hold your breath.



Floor 5F


Open the Treasure Chest. The Chest contains ERDRICK'S ARMOUR. Equip it on the
Hero. Now backtrack to Floor 3F.



Floor 3F


Backtrack until you reach the stairs you originally took to get on this floor.
Head west to the dark room and continue walking until you reach the stairs.



Floor 4F


Heal to max and Quick Save in case of heavy Green Dragon fire. Head upstairs.



Floor 5F


Head east to a Treasure Chest. It contains the MAD CAP. Equip it on either the
Prince or the Princess. If you equip it on the Princess, the cost of Kaboom will
be reduced to 6MP, so that is something to think about. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



Floor 3F


Head east back towards where you ascended to this floor. This time, take the
northwest path and get the Treasure Chest, which contains ~1450G. Follow the
path north until you hit the northern wall. You should be at a fork in the road.
Start heading west. Follow this path to the end and go up the stairs.



Floor 4F


Another Green Dragon warning. Heal and Quick Save. Climb the stairs.



Floor 5F


Head south, then west to the Treasure Chests. Inside them are a THANATOS' SHIELD
and ~592G. Do not equip this shield as it is Cursed. Backtrack to Floor 3F.



Floor 3F


Head east until you are back at the fork in the path. This time, take the
eastern path and go up the stairs.



Floor 4F


You know the drill. Heal and Quick Save before you climb the stairs.



Floor 5F


Take 3 steps north and 1 step west to fall into a pit.



Floor 4F


Head to the corner in the southwest of this room. From the corner, head 1 step
east and 1 step north to fall into a pit.



Floor 3F


Collect the THUNDERBOLT BLADE. Give it to the Hero and equip it. You can use it
as an item to cast lightning on multiple monsters in a group. Hand your Aurora
Blade to the Prince so he can equip it.

Note : Hargonauts have a chance to drop a second Thunderbolt Blade. Although
       only the Hero can equip the weapon, it can be used as an item in battle
       by another party member.

This is an opportune time to Evac out and Zoom to Beran to rest up. If you are
running low on MP, the entrance to the Cave to Rendarak is a short walk away
from here. Head east to the dead end to fall into a pit, then head directly
north to fall into another pit. You should be back at the beginning of the cave.



<<-----------------------xxxvi. CAVE TO RENDARAK 2 [WK36]--------------------->>


After you have rested up, head back to the Cave to Rendarak via the Teleportal
in Beran.



Floor 1F


There is a trap floor 5 steps east and 5 steps north of the stairs to the east
of where you start. Avoid that spot and make your way northeast to the eastern
stairs.



Floor 2F


Walk east and take the third path going north to the stairs.



Floor 3F


Walk as far north as you can, then take the path going east to the stairs.



Floor 4F


Final Green Dragon warning. From here on out, you will be going through their
territory. Quick Save often and stay healthy. Do not worry about using MP
because you saved your Prayer Rings for this. Climb the stairs.



Floor 5F


From the stairs, head 2 steps north, 4 steps west, 2 steps south, 3 steps west,
3 steps south and 1 step east. Now walk south to the wall, east to the wall and
north 1 step to go up the stairs.



Floor 6F


On this floor you will be presented with many branches of paths. Taking the
wrong ones will bring you back to where you are now.

Start by heading east.

At the first fork, go west.

At the second fork, go east.

Cross this room via the southernmost path and take the eastern way out of the
room.

At this fork, take the northeast path.

Take the northwestern path.

Take the northern path.

Take the eastern path. Continue east until you reach the stairs.



<<-------------------------xxxvii. RENDARAK [WK37]---------------------------->>


Welcome to the snowy plateau of Rendarak! Some of the monsters here have instant
death spells that can hit your entire party, so be sure to Heal and Quick Save
after each battle.

Here we have some new monsters. Cyclops can do a grievous hit. Frostburns can
cast Kasap, Kabuff and Thwack. The chance of Thwack killing a party member is
low but there nonetheless. Also, there are Silvapithecus that can put your party
to sleep with its Sickly-Sweet Breath and can also cast Sizzle.

From the cave exit, head east, then northeast through the snow. After a bit of a
walk you should be able to spot a Shrine next to four bridges. Enter the Shrine.
Congratulations! You have just made it through the most difficult part in the
game! Well, apart from the final boss, that is.

Now you should have all Zoom points in the game.

Talk to the Priest to get your HP and MP filled. You can use the Teleportal to
get back to Beran if you wish but it is more convenient to use Zoom.

North and west of the Shrine you can run into some new monsters. The Gigantes
can do a grievous hit on you. They can drop Swords of Ruin which sell for 11250G
a pop. Archdemons can hit your party with a fiery Torrent of Flames or they can
Kaboom your party. Back to back Kabooms can be dangerous. They can drop Prayer
Rings.

Oh boy. The Batmandrills. They were called Gold Batboons in the NES version and
were a source of frustration to many Dragon Warrior II players. They have Poison
Breath, Fire Breath and they can attack twice. They can cast Sizzle. But they
also have another spell: Kamikazee. There is a chance that they can use
Kamikazee if they are low on HP. Called Sacrifice in the NES game, this spell is
guaranteed to kill everybody in your party. Half your gold gone instantly. I
remind you that there is no Vault in the NES game. I hope you saved, because if
you did not, you are going to have to do all that grinding AGAIN. Fortunately,
this version has Quick Save, so be sure to make full use of it. Also,
Batmandrills have a chance of dropping Wailer's Mail which you can sell for
4800G a pop.



<<----------------xxxviii. HARGON'S CASTLE 1 (OPTIONAL) [WK38]---------------->>


You are not ready for the final boss yet, but there are a couple of items you
can pick up in Hargon's Castle on the first floor. Both items are cursed, but
you can sell them for gold. Make sure you Quick Save often in case of multiple
Kabooms, Thwack or Kamikazee on the way. Also, bring the Eye of Rubiss with you.

From Rendarak Shrine, head west across the bridges. Keep heading west until you
see a narrow forested path to the northwest. Enter this passage and follow it
south. Once you hit the water, you should be able to barely see a Castle to the
south. This is your final destination. Either head southwest through the forest
or southeast through the hills until you see a hilly path south of Hargon's
Castle. Head north through this path to the Castle.

Welcome to... Midenhall? What is going on? The King of Midenhall has joined with
Hargon in the name of justice? WHAT? Why is everybody praising this guy? He
KILLED the King of Moonbrooke and many of his guards! How could everybody forget
that? How convenient. Something is very wrong here.

Try using the Eye of Rubiss. Oh. Well, there you go. Welcome to the REAL
Hargon's Castle!



Floor 1F


There are no random encounters on this floor. However, if you talk to the flames
next to the Throne, you will fight 2 Batmandrills, each one in their own
grouping.

Stand directly west of the Throne. Go 1 step north, 1 step west, then cast Safe
Passage. Go north 1 step into a damage tile and a "!" should appear above your
head. Use your Gold Key or cast Click (if you have it) to open the door. Step
into the blackness. Head northwest harmlessly to a Chest which contains a
DEVIL'S TAIL.

From this Chest, go 1 step east into the blackness and cast Safe Passage again.
Now head to the northeast room to a Chest which contains a WAILER'S MAIL.

The middle room leads upstairs to the rest of the Castle. However, you are not
yet ready for that. Instead, get out of here. If you try to cast Evac, it will
not work. However, casting Zoom does. Zoom back to Rendarak Shrine. Find a town
and sell the cursed items you just collected.



<<-------------------------xxxix. FINAL GRIND [WK39]-------------------------->>


This is the last grind you will have to do, and it will be your longest grinding
session in the game by far. I suggest grinding in the hills west of Rendarak
Shrine because the item drops from these monsters are well worth it.

I recommend you get the Hero to level 43, the Prince to level 42 and the
Princess to level 40. This means you are going to be here for a little while.
Hargon's Castle is easy but the final boss is not. Plus, you will need gold for
some new equipment that will be helpful against the final bosses.

Quick Save after every couple of battles. You WILL be wiped out every so often
during this grind. Feel free to abuse the hell out of Kaboom.

As soon as you can afford to, Zoom to Burrowell or Slewse, buy a third Power
Shield for 21500G and give it to the Princess. Now every party member can heal
themselves for free during battle.

If you manage to earn 65000G, Zoom to Burrowell and buy the Mink Mantle. You can
equip it on either the Prince or the Princess. If you choose to equip it on the
Princess, equip the Flowing Dress on the Prince.

If you manage to earn another 25000G, Zoom to Slewse and buy the Falcon Blade
and give it to the Hero. You get 2 attacks with this weapon. If both hits land,
it will deal more or less the same damage as your Thunderbolt Blade does with
one hit, depending on the monsters' resilience. However, if you defeat a monster
with the first attack, you will immediately attack another monster with the
second hit. Therefore, you have the potential to hit two monsters in one turn
with this weapon. Do not get rid of the Thunderbolt Blade, as it is still useful
against monsters with high resilience.

If you manage to earn yet another 25000G, you can buy a Falcon Blade for the
Prince if you want. However, his Aurora Blade already does a decent amount of
damage. I do not recommend doing any extra grinding for it. But if you have the
money anyway, you may as well grab it.

At the end of your grind, your party should look like the following below:

Now, walk back to Hargon's Castle, making sure you have the Eye of Rubiss and
the False Idol with you. If you decided to go all the way to level 50, Holy
Protection will work here.



<<-------------------------xl. HARGON'S CASTLE 2 [WK40]----------------------->>


Use the Eye of Rubiss to dispel the illusion.



Floor 1F



Head north until you are 1 step north and 2 steps west of the Throne. As before,
cast Safe Passage, head north 1 step and either use your Gold Key or cast Click
to unlock the hidden door. This time, head to the middle room and use your Gold
Key or Click it open. Walk north to the centre of the cross. Use the False Idol
in this spot.



Floor 2F


You can run into Dancing Flames on this floor and the next floor above. They can
use fire attacks and call other Dancing Flames. Their HP is low so you should be
able to make quick work of them no problem.

Head up the stairs to the northeast.



Floor 3F


On this floor you can run into Wrecktors. You have met this monster before at
Midenhall when you picked up your Lightning Staff earlier in the game. If you
recall, he has Kasap, Kabuff and Kaboom. But because he has help this time, he
can make use of his Kazing spell which revives a random monster to full HP and
is guaranteed to succeed. Kill these monsters first if you see them.

Follow the winding path to the stairs.



Floor 4F


On this floor and the floors above, there are no more random encounters. Make
your way to the stairs but stop a few steps before you reach the square next to
them. Heal up to max and Quick Save. Now take a few steps east for a battle.

Head up the stairs to the final floor.



Floor 7F


Cast Safe Passage before you move anywhere. Head west and north up to Hargon.
Heal to max and Quick Save. Make sure the Hero is holding the Yggdrasil Leaf.
Talk to Hargon. It does not matter if you answer "Yes" or "No" to his question.
Either way, prepare for the final battle!

Hurrah! Hargon is dead! With his dying breath, Hargon mumbles something about
Malroth. Who is Malroth? It is probably not important. Cast Evac and... oh, Evac
is not working. Okay, cast Zoom and... ow, your aching heads. I guess you will
have to walk out of here.

Go south and... what the...? Okay, try going west, and... wait! What's going on
here? Heal to max, use any Prayer Rings you have and Quick Save. Try going east
now and... IT'S A TRAP!

| MALROTH - 1750 HP - 240+ MP - Can cast Kasap and Kabuff. He can also use     |
|                               Blistering Flames and has a chance of attacking|
|                               twice.                                         |

| Malroth cannot be killed by Hocus Pocus. Fortunately, he is unable to heal   |
| himself. Attack with the Hero and cast Kabuff and Kasap on the first turn.   |
| In the subsequent turns, Kabuff when he uses Kasap and Kasap when he uses    |
| Kabuff. His Blistering Flames can pack a wallop, especially to the party     |
| member with the Flowing Dress. Heal anybody who goes below 120 HP. Kazing    |
| anyone who dies.                                                             |

| I do not recommend going all out with Malroth. Although it will take a little|
| time, this battle is more easily won if you take a defensive approach. Stay  |
| healed and defend when necassary. Use the Power Shields after every flame    |
| attack. Make sure you are Kabuffed to max and Malroth is Kasapped to max.    |
|                                                                              |
| After perhaps a dozen turns, Malroth will go down. Victory! This means the   |
| game is over now, right? RIGHT?                                              |
