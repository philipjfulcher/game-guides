This Persona 3 Portable 100% Walkthrough will get you all possible Trophies, Achievements, and Social Links (S-Links) in a single playthrough. This is updated for the PS4 and Steam version of the game released in 2023. At the start of the game you can pick between a Male or Female character. This walkthrough is specifically for the MALE character, this is very important for the S-Links! The S-Link requirements for the other gender are different.

A playthrough will take roughly 40 hours. For all trophies you will need to do 2 playthroughs, one with each gender for trophy “A Pair of Wild Cards”. Some dialogues and relationships are also different between the characters-

With this walkthrough, you will be able to get all S-Links maxed out for the Male Character, and also you will max out all social abilities.

You will skip into march now, you will have two more days 3/3 and 3/5, but you can basically do nothing unless you wanna talk to some characters. So you can go straight to the dorm and into bed to skip the remaining days. After the credits, you are forced to make a save. Select a new save slot so you don’t overwrite your master save from 1/31. This save will be your cleared game save. When you are back in the main menu, you can choose the cleared save game to start a New Game +.

Congratulations, you finished Persona 3 Portable.
