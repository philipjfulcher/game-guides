**10/1 Thursday**

**  
Morning**

Stay Awake (Academics +1)

**After School**

> How many responses you get in Yukari's next social link, changes depending on what responses you choose. For this reason, I'd recommend choosing the same options here, so there isn't any confusion.

Spend Time with Yukari

- Look around
- Go look for her
- Any
- Any
- (Lovers Rank 5)
- I’m sorry (+3)

**Evening**

Head to Club Escapade and buy Assassin Site Note and History Website Note from the Suspicious Man.

Get a Fortune reading of your choice.

Speak to Fuuka and head to Tartarus.

**Dark Hour**

> **Important! Important!**
> Even though you've been doing all search and rescues, make sure you don’t miss any tonight. You will permanently lock yourself out of a social link if you do.

You now have access to the 3 best Major Arcana Cards, Lovers, Justice, and Devil. Lovers will boost the fusion bonus of your social links, while Justice allows you to choose 2 cards from every shuffle time, and the Devil will double the number of items you get from breaking objects and enemy drops. While none of these are essential, they can save you a lot of time in levelling personas and in farming for skill cards, yen, exp, etc.

> **Important! Important!**
> If you've been following the fusion guide, make sure Ose has learned Life Aid and Hanuman has learned Endure, before doing the next batch of fusions. Ose should have reached a high enough level to learn Life Aid, if you had the Lovers Arcana active when you fused him.
>
> Hanuman cards are in shuffle times in this next section, so it should be easy to get the exp needed for him. You can also teach him Growth 2; I'd replace Fatal End.
>
> Rank 8 skill cards start dropping tonight, which means you can start getting Resist skill cards, these are great as they can turn an elemental weakness into a strength on a persona. These have a very low drop rate though, and you'll be able to get them from the Antiques shop later on in the game, so I wouldn't go out of your way to farm them, just grab any that appear in shuffle times.
>
> Resist Dark and Resist Light don't appear in the antiques shop, if you want these cards you will have to farm them, highly optional.

> You'll get introduced to the Dark Zone tonight. It's an area that's completely pitch black, forcing you to use the mini map to navigate. It's harder for you to see shadows, but it's also harder for them to see you. The main feature of these floors is that all breakable objects are Twighlight Fragment statues. If you have the Devil Arcana active you can collect a decent amount of Twighlight Fragments each time you come across a Dark Zone.
>
> Outside of the tutorial one, they are random spawns. Unfortunately, the tutorial one doesn't count for the achievement, but the next time you encounter it, you will unlock:
>
> - Achievement/Trophy: The Horror of the Shade (33/48)
>
> You should also at some point today unlock:
>
> - Achievement/Trophy: Glimpse of the Depths (34/48) (Conquer 10 Monad doors)

Return to the 117F and continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 125F, for your next back-to-back gatekeeper fights. Defeat them, then open the chests, equip Makoto with the Ballistic Vest and Ken with the Warding Shoes.

> In the next section you'll get introduced to a new type of shadow, the Greedy Shadow. They go around stealing all the loot on the floor and you end up in a mini game, trying to chase them down. You have 3x choices of either left or right, if you guess right all three times, then you catch it and get to fight it. They give a lot of exp and loot when defeated. Normally it's luck of the draw if you guess the right direction or not, but the tutorial one seems like it's guaranteed.
>
> You'll hit much higher numbers against Greedy Shadows so you should be able to do over 999 damage against them. They're weak to strike, any strong strike attack like Herculean Strike will easily do this.
>
> - Achievement/Trophy: Get a Load of Those Numbers (35/48)

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 132F for the next gatekeeper, after defeating it, open the chests. I'd only give Shinjiro, Gaea's Grave, if you don't already have Charun's Hammer. The Auto Rebellion on Charun's Hammer is better than the slightly higher attack stat on Gaea's Grace.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 136F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it and open the chests, then give the Fiery Vest to Akihiko.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you hit the 143F, defeat the final gatekeeper of the block, then open the chests and equip Ken with Ote-gine.

The Monad passage is also on the 143F, defeat the first enemy and give the Grand Slasher to Koromaru. After defeating the second and third enemies, open the chest to get the Tower Arcana card.

Head up to the 144F for the border floor, open the chest and return to the entrance.

Hand in quests 59, 61, 64 and 65.

Elizabeth will now ask you to escort her to Gekkoukan.

> You can return to previous Tartarus blocks and farm the Monad doors for the base materials and gemstones, but the lower blocks drop lower quality base materials than what you were able to get tonight.

> If you're using DLC personas click, [DLC Fusion Guide October 1st.](dlc-fusion-guide-main-game#october-1st)

You'll want to farm until you have 360k, Ose has learned Life Aid and Hanuman has learned Endure. Lovers Arcana is recommended but not essential, some skills might not match up if you decide to fuse without the Lovers Arcana.

When you're ready, save your game, enter the Velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

You should have every fused persona up to level 46 now.

Hand in quest 62 to Elizabeth, which unlocks:

- Fusion Series #6: Strength, Siegried

The personas you should have on are **Titania, White Rider, Dominion, Mishaguji, Succubus, Kurama Tengu, Okuninushi, Lachesis, Cu Chulainn, Kaiwan, Grimekhala,** and **Parvati**

- Teach Succubus Growth 2, replace Maragion. Replace Growth 2 with Eigaon when Succubus learns it
- Teach Growth 2 to Lachesis, replace Mediarama
- Teach Cu Chulainn Growth 2, replace Torrent Shot
- Teach Growth 2 to Titania, replace Matarukaja.

> As you can see, you've replaced Invigorate 2 with Life Aid, it restores 8% SP/HP after every fight, it's a nice upgrade over Invigorate 2 and because it's % based, it gets better the more you level up. You've also replaced Auto Sukukaja with Endure. Endure is just a great skill to have in case you get one tapped by an insta-kill skill, or you get smacked down on your weakness and can save you from a game over screen. You'll also soon be getting some gear that has Auto Sukukaja on it.

You'll want at least **150k** after selling all your loot. You'll also get 100k reward from a rescued person tomorrow.

> **Important! Important!**
> Make sure you have personas from the following arcana’s for the next batch of social links before leaving: **Lovers, Strength, Justice, Hierophant, Priestess, Temperence, Fortune, Tower, Star,** and **Moon,** these are going to be the social links that you'll be working on. You will want at least **150k** after selling your loot.
>
> If you want to buy all shopping channel items, you will need at least 200k.
>
> If you want to work out what your loot is worth before you leave, then you can use [Loot and Breakable Objects Tziah Block 1](loot-and-breakable-objects#tziah-block-1-119f-144fbreakable-objects), which has the name and sale values of everything.

> If you're not following the fusion guide, you may need to farm more yen, the amounts calculated here don't include any additional persona swapping that I don't specifically mention.\*\*

For some allies you can choose between protecting their weakness or going for damage. I prefer protecting their weaknesses, I find it makes certain fights easier than raw damage, but either approach can work.

> If you have the gemstones spare, grab the Growth 3 card. Don't stress if you don't though, you can keep using Growth 2 instead. Make 5x copies of whichever one you are using. You can buy Emeralds in Club Escapade, they are 10k each though.
>
> If you have some spare Amethyst gems it might be worth trading for some Dekaja Gems and Dekunda Gems, they can be useful against enemies that buff or de-buff a lot. 3 to 5 of each should be plenty, you can also buy Amethyst from Club Escapade for 5k.

| White Rider and Cu Chulainn Result: Hecatoncheires | Charge, Auto Tarukaja, Life Aid and Growth 2 | Vile Assault, Heatwave, Regenerate 2 and Endure |

- Replace Growth 2, with Growth 3 if you have it. Replace Growth 2/3 with Auto Maraku when it reaches level 53

As usual I'd recommend getting the Lovers, Justice and Devil cards if you can.

Return to 143F and continue until you reach the 151F for first gatekeeper of the block. Defeat it and open the chests, then give the Hero's Cape to Ken.

Continue climbing until you reach the 155F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it, then open the chests and give Aristocracy to Mitsuru.

Continue climbing until you reach the 161F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it, then open the chests and give the Tetra Jammer armour to whoever you think needs it the most.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 170F for your next back-to-back gatekeeper fights, defeat both of them and open the chests. I wouldn't give Akihiko Rapid Bands, the Endure on the Champion Gloves is better than the slightly higher attack stat.

Skip the Monad passage for the moment, you're about to make one of the best personas in the game, which will make the passage much easier to do. Head up to the 172F for the border floor and open the chest.

Return to the entrance and hand in quest 70 to Elizabeth.

> You can return to the first part of Tziah and grab the Monad doors here if you want extra base materials and gemstones for gear crafting. It drops all the same ones as the second part of Tziah.

> If you're using DLC Personas, then click [DLC Fusion Guide October 30th.](dlc-fusion-guide-main-game#october-30th)

You'll want to farm until you have 500k, are at least level 56 and Hectoncheires has learnt Auto Maraku. Lovers Arcana is recommended but not essential.

When you're ready, save your game, enter the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

> Most of the personas will now have Auto Maraku which increases defence for the entire party for the first 3 turns, and Enduring Soul. Enduring Soul is like Endure but will also fully restore your hp when activated.

You just unlocked two new Theurgies:

- Best Friends, which gives Concentrate and Charge  
   (From having Decarabia and Forneus)
- Scarlot Havoc  
   (From having Siegfried and Mithras)

Dismiss Succubus, Rangda and Decarabia

The persona's that you want to have on you are **Parvati, Titania, Throne, Atropos, Siegfried, Suzaku, Chernobog,** **Cu Chulainn, Nidhoggr** and **Ganesha**

Hand in quest 71 to Elizabeth

- Teach Growth 2/3 to Chernobog, replace Poision Mist
- Teach Growth 2/3 to Atropos, replace Dekunda
- Teach Growth 2/3 to Suzaku replace Diarahan, replace Growth with Fire amp at level 61

> Nidhoggr will be your buff and de-buff persona for the rest of the game. It has nearly every buff and debuff on it, you're just missing Marakukaja and Masukunda. They are both rank 9 skill cards, but are optional, only farm them if you want to complete the set. If you want a perfect buff and de-buff persona you can also teach him Dekaja and Dekunda.

> Mahamaon with Hama Boost on shadows that are weak to light, has a very good to chance to one shot them. If it misses any in a group, you can use Kougan on any stragglers.

> Siegfried is one of the best physical personas in the game, which is why he is more specialized for crit rate and damage. Make sure to use his Charge ability before you use the new Scarlet Havoc Theurgy and have Siegfried as the active persona when using Scarlet Havoc.
>
> I'd replace Brave Blade with either Slash Boost or Multi-Target Boost. Slash boost gives 25% damage bonus but needs to be farmed, whereas Multi-Target Boost is a 15% damage bonus, but you get it from Elizabeth. Both works well so go with whatever you have.
>
> If you farmed an Apt pupil earlier, I'd replace Auto Rebellion for it. Both give extra crit, the only difference is Apt Pupil is an unconditional crit boost, whereas Auto Rebellion requires Siegfried to be the starting persona. Again, both work well so go with whatever you have.
>
> I'd replace Life Aid with Growth 2/3, then replace Growth with Slash Amp when it hits level 61.
>
> The reason for these changes is because the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy with Slash Amp, Slash Boost/Multi-Target Boost and Charge can nearly one-shot any enemy in the game, even gatekeepers and Monad Bosses on Merciless. All those skills work on Deathbound too, so even though we actually deleted a stronger skill in Brave Blade, the extra damage from Slash Boost/Multi-Target Boost on both Deathbound and Scarlet Havoc easily make up for it.

Return to the 171F and enter the Nomad Passage, defeat the first shadow and give the Whirlwind Bow to Yukari. Defeat the second and third shadows, then open the chests to get the Star Major Arcana.

You'll want to have at least **275k** yen after selling all your loot.

> **Important! Important!**
> Make sure you have personas from the following arcana's **Strength, Star, Temperence, Lovers, Moon, Justice, Fortune, Priestess,** and **Tower,** these are going to be the social links that you'll be working on. You will want to have at least **275k** after selling your loot
>
> If you want to buy all shopping channel items, you will need at least 370k.
>
> If you want to work out what your loot is worth before you leave, then you can use [Loot and Breakable Objects Tziah Block 2](loot-and-breakable-objects#tziah-block-2-145f-172fbreakable-objects), which has the name and sale values of everything.

> If you're not following the fusion guide, you may need to farm more yen, the amounts calculated here don't include any additional persona swapping that I don't specifically mention.\*\*

**After School**

Sell your loot and collect your rewards.

> **Important! Important!**
> You're about to do your first rank up where you must choose whether you want to stay friends or commit to a relationship. If you want to have the option to see the Christmas Eve date scene for that character, then you must be in a relationship with them.

Spend time with Chihiro

- Don't worry, she'll help us (+1)
- You need to tell her yourself (+1)
- Any
- What's gotten into you? (+1)
- (Justice Rank 9)
- **Platonic:** I like working with you, but...
- Any
- **Relationship:** I feel the same, Chihiro.
- Any

If you choose to get into a relationship here, you will unlock:

- Achievement/Trophy: That Special Someone (38/48)

> You don’t have to get into a relationship with Chihiro for this achievement, but you will need to enter a relationship with someone before the end of the game. If you want the achievement now but don’t want to be in a relationship with Chihiro, choose the relationship route, then use the rewind feature to go back to after school.
