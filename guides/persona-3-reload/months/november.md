Head to the antiques shop and upgrade your gear, make sure you get Mikazuki Munechika today, if you haven't already. You'll want to get the Growth 3 card today if you weren't able to grab it last time.

> If you want to make the best gear in the game, you're going to need Heart Items from most of the best personas in the game. You'll be needing a decent amount of Growth 3, around 30 of them. You don't need to prioritize Growth 3 atm, as you won't need the majority of them until the end of January, but it's a good idea to make a start on them now.
>
> If you're someone who wants to collect every item from the antiques shop, then you are going to need a lot of Growth 3. You will need re-fuse and re-level a number of end game personas to get enough Heart Items for everything, as many items require Heart Items from the same persona.
