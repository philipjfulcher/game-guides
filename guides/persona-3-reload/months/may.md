**Evening**

> Elizabeth’s quests unlock tonight. They give some amazing items, yen, personas and are also one of your main sources of Twighlight Fragments. The other main source of Twighlight Fragments comes from levelling up social links.
>
> **Important! Important!**  
> You'll need to do Elizabeth's quests in order to follow this guide. Some of them give social stat points, which this guide uses. If you start skipping quests, you may find yourself not having access to quests at the correct time and not getting a social rank up when needed.

Go see Elizabeth to start her quests, she’s at the back of Paulownia Mall, and accept:

- 1\. Bring me a Muscle Drink
- 2\. Retrieve the first old document
- 3\. Shadow Hunting Milestone
- 4\. Treasure Hunting Milestone
- 5\. Create a Persona that’s level 13 or above
- 8\. Experiment with fortune telling
- 12\. Bring me pine resin

You should be able to turn in quest 2 and 3, which unlocks:

- 7\. Bring me a Juzunaru
- 14\. Retrieve the second old document
- 15\. Shadow Hunting Milestone #2

Accept these ones too. Elizabeth will then inform you that a change has happened within Tartarus, which means the next block of Tartarus is now available, you won’t be going back to Tartarus for a little bit though.

> The Shadow Hunting and Treasure Hunting quests might complete at different times for you, depending on how much you farm. I would try to keep up with the guide, as Elizabeth will ask you to escort her to various location, which unlock after completing a pre-determined number of quests. Elizabeth's hangouts sometimes give you additional persona fusions and will change some of the fusion recipes. You'll need these unlocked at the same time as the guide to be able to follow the fusion guide. Don't worry if you complete the Shadow and Treasure quests earlier than the guide though, all that happens is you just unlock the next one in the series.

> You'll see an ! mark over Paulownia Mall, it's just saying the fortune teller for quest 8 is here. You can ignore it for now as you don't need it until the next time you go to Tartarus.

Go to Aohige Pharmacy at Paulownia Mall and buy a Muscle Drink. Return to the dorm and speak to Yukari, then return to Elizabeth and hand in both quests. Afterwards you'll receive 3 more quests.

- 9\. I’d like to try all kinds of drinks
- 10\. I’d like to try a beef bowl
- 13\. Bring me a handheld game console

Accept all of these and return to the dorm and speak to Junpei. Return to Elizabeth and hand in quests 9 and 13. You'll need to select “Hand over the drinks” command to complete quest 13. You'll receive one more additional quest:

- 11\. Please prevail in the Big Eater Challenge

Accept the quest. Equip Pixel Vest on Makoto, then give Yukari, the Hothead Shirt and the Toy Bow.

**Evening**

Head to club Escapade and get a fortune reading for 3,000 yen, you'll need it for a quest.

Talk to Mitsuru to go to Tartarus.

**Dark Hour**

> **Important! Important!**
> If you’re playing the game on a higher difficulty and want to keep the difficulty up, be very careful farming golden hands and getting exp cards from shuffle times, from this point onwards. Both of these can make it very easy to over-level and remove any difficulty from the game, if you don’t care about over levelling then farm away.
>
> Akihiko is back, so you now have a party of 4. Between having a 4th member and being at a much higher level than the last time you went to Tartarus, you'll have a lot more SP. If you’ve been keeping up with the vending machines and quests, then you should also have a decent amount of SP restorative items too. The enemies are stronger this time, so you'll still need to manage your SP. I’d recommend the same tactics as before; remember there’s always the grand clock at the start if you run out of SP restorative items.
>
> Since the game first game out, Atlus has released an update that increases the amount of Twilight Fragments you get from your initial social links. You can use your Twilight Fragments more freely now.

> From tonight onwards, you don't want to be collecting personas from shuffle times unless I specifically say. This is because the personas you get from shuffle times only have a few skills on them, meaning you won't be able to pass on the same number of skills as in the guide.
>
> You also run the risk of overwriting that persona in the compendium when you go to register your personas, deleting all the skills you've passed to it and potentially messing up the fusion guide.

Some of the locked chests can contain some nice pieces of gear, unfortunately the drops are random. Any pieces you do get, I’d recommend giving it to whoever has the weakest gear at the time. Somewhere along the line you should unlock:

- Achievement/Trophy: Briefcase Burglar (opened 50 chests) (11/48)

> Archangel has Kouha for light weak enemies.

When you're ready, head to the teleporter and resume from the 21F, continue working your way up to 28F for the first gatekeeper fight of the block, then return to the entrance and save your game.

Take on the gatekeeper, after defeating it continue working your way up Tartarus until you reach 34F.

> You'll be introduced to the “Formidable Shadow” on the 30F. They are significantly stronger than other enemies in the area so they can quickly decimate your party on higher difficulties. They do give some nice exp and tend to drop some of the rarer loot you need for gear crafting later on in the game.

Save your game, have at least 15k then return to the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

| **Fusion Recipe**                        | **Skills to Pass On**            |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Inugami and Archangel Result: Unicorn    | Bufu, Garu, Agi and Zio          |
| Onmoraki and Inugami Result: Nigi Mitama | Bufu, Poisma and Tarunda         |
| Omoikane amd Archangel Result: Slime     | Single Shot, Kouha, Bufu and Agi |
| Jack Frost and Slime Result: Berith      | Pulinpa, Evil Touch and Bash     |
| Unicorn and Berith Result: Tam Lin       | Agi, Kouha, Bufu and Single Shot |

Summon back Berith.

Afterwards hand in quests 4, 5, 8 and 15, which unlocks four more:

- 6\. Create a Persona with Kouha
- 16\. Treasure Hunting Milestone #2
- 17\. Fusion Series #1: Emperor, Oberon
- 22\. Shadow Hunting Milestone #3

You should be able to hand in number 6 straight away, then accept the rest.

Return to the 34F and take on the next gatekeeper, which turns out to be your first back-to-back gatekeeper fights. Once you’ve beaten them, open the chests to get a Juzumaru for Junpei.

Make your way up to the 42F and face the final gatekeeper of this block. Recommend saving beforehand, this gatekeeper is by far the strongest you've faced so far. If you want help defeating this shadow, highlight the following box.

> This fight can be a nightmare if you don't have a proper strategy for it. It identifies everyone's weakness and goes after them relentlessly. On merciless it can easily one shot any party member from full health, get a one more and wipe the entire party out in quick succession.
>
> To defeat this gatekeeper, you'll want to use Akihiko's Tarunda to keep its attack down, and use Poisma on Nigi Mitama, it might take a few tries but keep going till it lands. Junpei and Yukari will guard every single turn, and Akihiko will guard every turn he's not using Tarunda. Once you've got Poisma to land, guard with Makoto as well, the poison will rapidly deplete the shadows hp, while guarding and Tarunda will massively reduce the damage it does to your party. Poison can't kill a shadow though, so once its hp is nearly depleted, hit it with any attack to finish it off.

Afterwards make your way to the 44F and grab “Old Document 2” from the chest, then return to the entrance to hand in quests 7 and 14.

You'll likely need to do more farming for yen, as you have another batch of persona fusion coming up and you still need yen for your social activities for the coming weeks.

You'll want about 70k before doing the next batch of fusions. Once you've farmed it, save your game, register your personas and fuse:

| **Fusion Recipe**                                    | **Skills to Pass on**                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Nigi Mitama and Slime Result: Zouchouten             | Single Shot, Media, Baisudi, and Tarunda. Replace Bash with Assault Dive |
| Archangel and Zouchouten Result: Jack-o'-Lantern     | Auto Tarukaja, Zio, Kouha and Media                                      |
| Valkyrie and Jack-o'-Lantern Result: Oberon          | Auto Tarukaja, Kouha, Agi and Maragi                                     |
| Berith and Oberon Result: Rakahasa                   | Auro Tarukaja, Power Slash, Bash and Single Shot                         |
| Nigi Mitama and Rakshasa Result: Gurulu              | Auto Tarukaja, Bufu, Garu and Poisma                                     |
| Unicorn and Gurulu Result: Neko Shogun               | Auto Tarukaja, Kouha, Eiha and Poisma                                    |
| Tam Lin and Rakshasa Result: Naga                    | Auto Tarukaja, Fatal End Bash and Vaccum Slash                           |
| Jack-o'-Lantern and Nigi Mitama Result: Principality | Auto Tarukaja, Media, Agi and Maragi                                     |
| Oberon and Inugami Result: Pisaca                    | Auto Tarukaja, Foul Breath Bufu and Poisma                               |

> Auto Tarukaja is the first of the main skills you'll be focusing on in this guide. It gives attack up for the first 3 turns in every fight, as long as it's on the starting persona.

You should now have fused every persona up to level 17 in the compendium, except Fortuna from the Special Fusion section. Fill your stock with **Oberon, Zouchouten, Naga, Principality, Jack-o'-Lantern, Nigi Mitama, Inugami** and **Rakshasa,** you'll need to dismiss Neko Shogun, Pisaca and Chimera. You can now hand in quests 17 and 22 to Elizabeth now, unlocking two more:

- 25\. Fusion Series #2: Chariot, Mithras
- 31\. Shadow Hunting Milestone #4

You have completed enough quests that Elizabeth will ask you to show her around Paulownia Mall, you'll need to speak to her again to trigger it.

- 77\. I’d Like to walk around Paulownia Mall

You'll need at least 60k after selling your loot, you'll likely need around 10-20K on you, save your game before leaving Tartarus. Sell your loot the next day, and if you have less than 60k, then you'll need to reload and farm some more, remember you can sell items and old gear if you're a little short. You can also drop the difficulty to peaceful to increase the value of your loot.

> **Important! Important!**
> Make sure you have personas from the following arcana's before leaving Tartarus tonight. **Emperor, Chariot, Hermit, Justice, Magician, Temperence, Hanged and Strength,** these are the social links you're going to be working on. You'll also need at least **60\*\***k\*\* after selling all your loot.
>
> If you want to buy all the shopping channel items, you'll need at least 75k
>
> If you want to work out what your loot is worth before you leave, then you can use [Loot and Breakable Objects Arqa Block 1](loot-and-breakable-objects#arqa-block-1-23f-42f), which has the name and sale values of everything. The value of your loot depends on the difficulty you're playing on, values are listed for each difficulty.
>
> If you're not following the fusion guide, you may need to farm more yen, the amounts calculated here don't include any additional persona swapping that I don't specifically mention.\*\*

- 1x Power Incense I
- 1x Guard Incense I
- 1x Magic Incense I
- 1x Speed Incense I
- 1x Proto-Choker (Equip on Makoto)

> Incense can be used on your personas or party members’ personas. I wouldn’t use them on your personas at this stage in the game, you're going to be changing personas regularly, so they will just end up being wasted. I would also hold off on using them on your party members. Incenses are rare atm, and you've still got plenty of party members to join. I’d recommend waiting until you get every party member, then decide who your favourite ones are, then use your incenses on them.

> If you check out the bulletin board by Mitsuru, you can see how your party members did on the exams.

- Head to the nurse's office and drink the Strange Medicine (Courage +1)

Sell your loot at the police station, you're still not buying any gear from the police station.

> From today, you can start making use of Inari, the red section of the shrine. Inari will allow you to copy any skill card you have, it’s free and takes up no time, but can only be done once a day. For this guide you'll mostly be focusing on making copies of certain single-target and multi-target elemental spells, plus a few passives.
>
> The only card that you need to make a copy of atm, is another copy of Makouha. Feel free to duplicate any other skill cards that you have on you.
