Get a Gamble Fortune.

Speak to Fuuka and head to Tartarus.

**Dark Hour**

> I'd highly recommend getting the Devil Arcana tonight, it's going to significantly increase the speed you can farm Gold Quartz, Diamonds and Rubies which are needed for endgame gear. Try to get the Lovers Arcana as well if you can. You'll need to be level 82 or have the Sun Arcana to do tonight's fusions.
>
> Q rank skill cards will start dropping tonight, which means you can get Amp cards (50% damage increase), these are optional though, a lot of the best personas already naturally learn these as they level up. Q rank yen cards drop between 40 to 50k each time, so you can earn a lot of yen quickly.
>
> If you're planning on taking on the secret boss, you'll need to farm Ice Amp and Slash Amp.

Return to the 225F and begin climbing Tartarus, as soon as you reach the new block on the 227F you will unlock:  
(Judgement Rank 2)

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 230F for the first gatekeeper, defeat it and you will unlock:  
(Judgement Rank 3)

Open the chests and give the Hanzo's Sandals to Makoto, these have Auto Masuku on them, which means you can replace anyone who is using Silent Sandals, with Mysterious Geta if you have them. Equip the Antimatter Cannon on Aigis unless you have Pandemonium for her.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 236F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it and you will unlock:  
(Judgement Rank 4)

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 241F for the next gatekeeper, defeat it and you will unlock:  
(Judgment Rank 5)

Open the chests, I'd give the Godspeed Shoes to whoever doesn't have Mysterious Geta.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 246F for your next back-to-back gatekeeper fights, defeat the first one and you will unlock:  
(Judgment Rank 6)

Open the chests, I'd recommend giving the Goddess Boots to Mitsuru, her Diamond Dust and Concentrate skills use a lot of SP.

Head up to the 247F and defeat the gatekeeper and you will unlock:  
(Judgment Rank 7)

Open the chests, I wouldn't give Makoto Excalibur, even though the 100 SP is nice, you should basically have infinite SP between Life Aid and Spell Master.

Continue climbing Tartarus until you reach the 253F and you'll face 3 gatekeepers in a row, defeat the first one and you will unlock:  
(Judgement Rank 8)

Head up to the 254F, defeat the gatekeeper and you will unlock:  
(Judgment Rank 9)

Head up to the 255F and defeat the final gatekeeper. Afterwards you will unlock:  
(Judgement Rank 10)

The last Monad Passage is on the 255F, defeat the first shadow and second shadows and open the chests. I wouldn't give Myohou Muramasa to Makoto, the Dark Amp on it is only good for one element. Defeat the final shadow and afterwards, you'll see a door you can't access for now.

Head up to the 256F for the border floor and return to the entrance.

Hand in quest 99 to Elizabeth.

If you have the Lovers Arcana, are at least level 82 and have at least 1.2 million yen, then save your game, enter the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

> Hopefully you got the Devil's Arcana, as it will make this next stage a lot faster. You'll want to do all or most of your Ruby, Gold Quartz and Diamond farming now. Farming for endgame gear is completely optional, you can beat the final boss with your current gear and personas.
>
> How much you need to farm will depend on how many pieces of gear you want to upgrade for each character and how many characters you want to do endgame gear for. If you're only looking to take on the secret boss, get the ultimate weapons and a Null accessory for each character, then you will need:
>
> - Makoto, 15 Rubies (Weapon and Armour of Light for secret boss)
> - Junpei, 7 Rubies
> - Yukari, 5 Rubies
> - Akihiko, 5 Rubies
> - Mitsuru, 7 Rubies
> - Aigis, 7 Rubies (This does include Armour and Footwear)
> - Koromaru, 3 Rubies (For his Armour)
> - Ken, 5 Rubies
>
> Depending on who you're using, you are looking at around 30-35 Rubies for a core party (4 members) and 47 for everyone.
>
> If you also want to get Shoes of Light for everyone (Aigis and Koromaru can't equip), which have Ali Dance on them and are the best footwear in the game, that's an additional 5 Rubies per character, and would bring you up to 72 rubies for everyone. Even if you're planning on doing everyone, I wouldn't get Shoes of Light for Makoto, I'd keep Hanzo's Sandals for him. You can always teach Ali Dance to his personas and the Hanzo's Sandals have Auto Masuku, which when combined with Ali Dance on everyone else is a very effective combo.
>
> Some people also like to farm Armour of Light for everyone too, it does have the highest damage reduction, but it's debatable if it's actually the best armour. I prefer Fallen Noble Armour on my characters for Unshaken Will (null's mental ailments) and I find this more useful than a higher damage reduction. If you do want Armour of Light that's an additional 5 Rubies per character and would bring you up 97 Rubies for everyone.
>
> Depending on how many characters you are doing gear for, you will need somewhere between 30-50 Gold Quartz and anywhere between 30 to160 Diamonds. Armour of Light and Shoes of Light require 10 Diamonds each, so getting those for everyone majorly increases the amount you need.
>
> - Diamonds are 50k at Club Escapade
> - Gold Quartz can be exchanged at the Antiques shop for 5x Diamonds, so basically 250K
> - Rubies can't be brought or traded for, can only be farmed.
>
> The amount of farming needed for gearing up a core team, compared to everyone is significant. The game will give you close to what you need of Dead Moon's Husks, White Nihil Models and Nihil Black Models for a core team. If you want extra, then you'll need to farm, and they all have very low drop rates. There is a strategy for farming these base materials, but it is still very time consuming.
>
> You don't have to do it all tonight but considering the Devil Arcana doubles the number of Rubies, Gold Quartz and Diamonds you get every time one drops, it's best to do it tonight, instead of having to get the Devil Arcana again another night.
>
> I'd recommend working out which characters you want to upgrade and what gear you want to get for them, and farm all or most of what you need tonight, while the Devil Arcana is active.
>
> That way future Tartarus visits can be dedicated to just farming the last Tartarus block, for the striped chests, which have the Dead Moon's Husks, White Nihil Models and Nihil Black Models. The more endgame gear you want to make the more nights you will need to do this.
>
> Diamonds, Gold Quartz and Diamonds are all drops from shadows on floors 247 to 252. Rubies and Gold Quartz drop from the Formidable Shadow Tenjin Musha and Rubies and Diamonds drop from regular shadows on these floors. I'd keep track of what you get as drops, that way if there's one item you are needing of more than the others, you can then start focusing more on the normal shadows or Formidable Shadows, depending on what you need.
>
> You don't need to farm all your Gold Quartz and Diamonds, as you can buy more, and you will be getting a fair bit of yen while doing this. Buying Gold Quartz and Diamonds does add up quick though, and you will still need about 2.5 million to do the last of the fusions on the final day.
>
> While you're doing this keep an eye out for Vorpal Blade, Ice Amp and Slash Amp skills cards, all are Q rank. Ice Amp and Slash Amp are needed if you want to take on the secret boss and Vorpal Blade is an upgrade on Deathbound for Siegfried. You don't really need it, but if it comes up in a shuffle time, you may as well grab it.

Spend with Nozomi

(Moon Rank 10)

**Evening**

Harvest the Rooftop Garden, then plant Golden Tomato Sprout.

Sell you loot and upgrade your gear at the antiques shop. Make sure to grab Tonbo-kiri today.

> You won't be able to get most of the weapons, Armour of Light or Shoes of Light atm, as you'll be missing persona Heart Items. You'll be doing another batch of persona fusions at the end of the month, once you've finished up the social links, and you'll be getting the rest of the Heart Items then. You should be able to get most of the accessories now though.
>
> You can also use this opportunity to work out how much you need of each of the base materials, you will then know exactly, how much you need to farm of each in the future.
>
> Some gear requires Heart Items from the same persona, if any of the gear you are interested needs Heart Items from the same persona, then I'd recommend using the Ctrl + F in [Mayoido Antiques Gear](mayoido-antiques-gear) section and search for that Heart Item. You'll be able to find out exactly which persona it comes from, and you'll know which persona you need to fuse and level more than once.
>
> If you're using DLC personas and have some spare yen, then getting some Magic Incenses for Mercurius, Kamu Susano-o and Seiten Taisei can be useful. Want to aim to get their magic stat to around 65-70, Incense II are the best value ones to get.

Hand in quest 91 to Elizabeth.

> This is the first of your free nights. There're a few things you can do, you can take a party member to Be Blue V and re-order their skills, you can go to the arcade and increases stats on an equipped persona. I'd recommend Siegfried, or you can go to Tartarus and farm Dead Moon's Husks, White Nihil Models and Nihil Black Models.
>
> For tonight I'd recommend going to Tartarus. Everyone should have Fallen Noble Armour and have Null Accessories to protect their weakness, which makes it the perfect time to take on the Reaper.
>
> To get the Reaper to Spawn, just spend 5 minutes on the same floor and he will appear. The Reaper is a very powerful shadow and can be a handful on merciless. but being able to protect your weakness and protect yourself from mental ailments makes the fight much more manageable. If you're having trouble beating the Reaper, you'll unlock a Theurgy with your final batch of persona fusions, that will allow you to one shot the Reaper.

If you manage to beat the reaper, return to entrance and hand in quest 100 to Elizabeth, which unlocks:

- Achievement/Trophy: Reaper Reaped (44/48)
- 101: Take out the ultimate adversary

This is the secret boss, and if you're interested in taking it on, you'll be doing it on the very final day.

Spend time with Keisuke

- Do you want to be a doctor (+3)
- (Fortune Rank 7)

**Evening**

Check the Fridge (1x Chilled Taiyaki and 1x Umugi Water)

> Each of the dorm hangouts has a very small additional scene. There isn't enough time to see all 16 of them, especially if you're farming endgame gear. What you can do though, is watch whatever is available that night, then use rewind. This can be repeated multi times for nights that have multiple dorm activities available. Then just do any activity you want like going to Tartarus or going to the arcade.
>
> By using the rewind feature you'll be able to see all 16 of bonus scenes by the end of the game.

Free Evening.

> If you're wanting to farm Dead Moon's Husks, White Nihil Models or Nihil Black Models, now is the perfect time to do it. You can get up to 6 per night of any combination of the 3 base materials, as all the drops are rng.
>
> This strategy isn't mine, I'll post the link for the video, but unfortunately the original video doesn't explain the strategy that well and has more detailed instructions on a random comment instead of in the description. For this reason, I've decided to write my own instructions here to make it easier for you to follow. If the strategy does help you, maybe click on the video, so the OP poster of the strategy gets the view on their video.
>
> The idea is to get Monad Doors to spawn on certain floors, you can do this by abusing Fuuka's Escape Ability and saving your game. Anytime a Monad Door spawns on a floor you don't want, you reload the save and try again, and anytime you get the floor spawn that you want, you use Fuuka's Escape ability to go back to the entrance to save the game. you rinse and repeat this and gradually climb Tartarus until you get to a specific floor. you then keep reloading until we do get a Monad Door to spawn on that specific floor.
>
> Even using this strategy, rng is a major factor you could be at it for an hour, or you could be at it for hours, and this is per night at Tartarus. Dead Moon's Husks, White Nihil Models or Nihil Black Models do not have high drop rate, If you're planning on doing this for multiple nights this could be a significant time sink.
>
> The Strategy\*\*

> 1.  You will want to save your game when you first enter Tartarus
> 2.  Start at the 236F and head up to the 237F

**Dark Hour**

> Now that you've finished all social links and linked episodes, you can finish of the compendium. You either need to be level 91 or at least level 86 with a Sun Arcana to do all the fusions tonight.
>
> If you need to level, the fastest way is to fight the Reaper, if you're struggling to defeat the reaper then you need to be level 88 or level 83 with the Sun Arcana to fuse Helel, the persona needed to get the Armageddon Theurgy, which can cheese the reaper.
>
> Helel is the first persona in the fusion section, so you can fuse that first if you need help with the Reaper. Once you have Helel and Satan in the compendium you will unlock the Armageddon Theurgy, it does 9,999 damage to any shadow but will drain all your SP and leave you with 1 HP. If you want to maximise your exp, fight the reaper solo, enter the fight with a full Theurgy, nuke the Reaper with Armageddon and he will die, make sure to grab an exp card from the shuffle time. Doing this shouldn't take more than a couple of fights to get you to level 91.

You'll want to run through the final block of Tartarus for the two missing people. You can either just run through and grab them or if you need exp and yen, you can fight shadows along the way. It might be worth grabbing the Monad Doors along the way, as they give a ton of Major Arcana cards. You don't really need specific ones tonight, except maybe Sun or possibly Devil, but If you need to farm more yen tonight, getting the Major Arcana cards from the Nomad Doors will make getting an Arcana Burst much easier. The Q rank cards drop significantly more yen than previous ranks.

It's up to you, if you want to get the Lovers Arcana card before doing fusions tonight. It can take a while though, it's probably quicker if you already have the yen to just fuse everything, teach the personas, Growth 3 and nuke the Reaper for exp, quickly unlocking any skills and Heart Items.

> If you're using DLC Personas, then click [DLC Fusion Guide January 30th](dlc-fusion-guide-main-game#january-30th).

When you have at least 2.5 million yen, save your game, enter the velvet room, register your personas and fuse:

Congratulations, you have just filled the compendium, and you just unlocked:

- Achievement/Trophy: Path to Salvation (46/48)

All that's left now is to get all the Heart Item from these personas. The quickest way to do this, is to teach Growth 3 to all of them, farm the Reaper solo, nuke him with Armageddon, then rinse and repeat. Your equipped persona should be Orpheus Telos for Victory Cry, then the 11 other personas should all be ones that need to drop Heart Items. You'll have to dismiss personas like Siegfried for now. If you're not intending to farm any endgame gear, this can all be skipped.

Make sure you leave and re-enter the velvet room, you will get a massive discount on summoning personas now.

The personas that you want on you are **Orpheus Telos, Scathach, Alilat, Surt, Shiva, Lucifer, Messiah, Metatron, Chi You, Asura, Sandalphon** and **Thanatos**

- Teach Growth 3 to Scathach, replace Freeze Boost. Replace Growth 3 with Auto Mataru, when it learns it
- Teach Growth 3 to Alilat, replace Inferno. Replace Growth 3 with Repel Pierce
- Teach Growth 3 to Surt, replace Auto Tarukaja. Replace Growth 3 with Fire Amp
- Teach Growth 3 to Shiva, replace Endure. Replace Growth 3 with Ali Dance
- Teach Growth 3 to Lucifer, replace Enduring Soul, Replace Growth 3 with Resist Phys
- Teach Growth 3 to Messiah, replace God's Hand. Replace Growth 3 with Magic Ability
- Teach Growth 3 to Metatron, replace Divine Judegment. Replace Growth 3 with Repel Elec
- Teach Growth 3 to Chi You, replace Spell Master. Replace Growth 3 with Drain Strike
- Teach Growth 3 to Asura, replace Unshaken Will
- Teach Growth 3 to Sandalphon, replace Salvation. Replace Growth 3 with Drain Dark
- Teach Growth 3 to Thanatos, replace Eiga

Run around and get your Theurgy ready. Once it's ready, remove all party members, set Orpheus Telos as the active persona, then wait for the Reaper to spawn and use Armageddon. Grab the exp card from the shuffle time, one fight should be enough to get the Heart Items from all these personas. Register these personas and then dismiss Thanatos, Scathach, Surt, Sandalphon, Shivea, Asura, Lucifer, Chi You and Messiah.

> If for any of these personas, you need more than one of their Heart Items, then don't register that persona. If you dismiss it straight away, you can summon it again and repeat this process.

Summon any other personas that you still need Heart Items from, I only had 5 more, Beelzebub, Vishnu, Kohryu, Lakshmi, and Cybele.

- Teach Growth 3 to Vishnu, replace Concentrate. Replace Growth 3 with Salvation
- Teach Growth 3 to Lakshmi, replace Diarahan. Replace Growth 3 with Salvation
- Teach Growth 3 to Kohryu, replace Invigorate 3
- Teach Growth 3 to Cybele, replace Diarahan

For any other personas that you still need to get Heart Items from, you'll have to choose what skill to delete for Growth 3, Farm the Reaper once more, but set Beelzebub has the active persona so it gets the exp without needing a Growth card. You should now have every heart item in the game.

Depending on how much endgame gear you are making, you may need to repeat this process a few more times, for duplicate Heart Items. Register and dismiss Vishnu, Lakshmi, Kohry uand Cybele.

The personas you want on you are **Orpheus Telos, Siegfried, Beelzebub, Alilat, Metatron, Saturnus, Odin and Ball Zebul**

> These are your final personas, if you've farmed any Resist, Null, Boost or Amp cards, you can teach them to these personas to cover any weakness, or for more damage if you want. You can also grab Ali Dance from the Antiques shop.
>
> If you're wondering about the curious build on Orpheus Telos, it's because you've started setting him up for the secret boss tomorrow.

All that's left now is farm enough yen to make all your endgame gear tomorrow. It's hard to put an estimate on how much you will need, as theirs a lot of different factors, but anywhere between 1 and 6 million yen should be enough to do endgame gear, depending on how many characters you are doing and how many gemstones you farmed. If you're wanting to take on the secret boss tomorrow, then you will need around an additional 2 million yen for all the incense cards that you will need.

My advice is farm the lowest amount of yen you think you will need, save the game and then leave Tartarus. If you don't have enough yen, you can just load your save and farm some more, plus it should give you a rough idea of how much more yen you need to farm.

> If you want to take on quest 101 tomorrow, you will have to make some very specific personas. It is by far the hardest boss in the game, and has some very strict rules, that if you violate causes an insta-kill Megidolaon attack that hits for 9,999. This boss is entirely optional, there is no achievement, or anything locked behind it.
>
> There's 3 skill card you need to farm tonight if you want to do the secret boss:
>
> - Rank 5, Slash Boost
> - Rank Q, Slash Amp
> - Qank Q, Ice Amp
>
> You'll need to re-fuse Chi You for the secret boss

> Teach Ice Amp and Endure to Orpheus Telos, replace Victory Cry and Enduring Soul. Remember you can always re-fuse Orpheus Telos after doing the secret boss if you want these skills back.

**Dark Hour**

> If you haven't done so, register all your personas. If your compendium isn't fully updated, your personas can lose stats and skills when you import it into Episode Aigis.

If you're taking on the secret boss, head to the depths of the Monad Passage on the 255F and enter the previously locked door.

When you're ready to take on the final boss, return to the 256F and continue past the last border floor.

> This is the only time in the game, you can get K rank cards to drop. You need an Arcana Burst and to farm past the 256F.

The 259F is a preparation floor, where you can choose your party. When you’re ready head up to the ramp for the first of the final bosses.

Once you’ve defeated the boss, continue climbing until you reach the next preparation floor, which is the 263F. Once you're ready, head up the ramp to take on the 2nd of the final bosses.

You get one more preparation area, once you're ready, head for the final boss of the game.

Once all is said and done you will unlock:

- Achievement/Trophy: The Great Seal (47/48)
