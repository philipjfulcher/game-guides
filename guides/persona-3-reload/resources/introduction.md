**Pre-game information**

Levelling up social links and completing linked episodes, will take up the bulk of your time outside of Tartarus and the main story. You get a huge amount of character development from them; they also allow you to get bonuses exp when fusing personas and will unlock powerful personas when they are maxed out. Linked episodes are a new additional to P3R and they are exclusively for the male party members, as they never had social links in the original game, they function very similar to social links though.

Evening dorm hangouts, Koromaru's walks, evening study sessions, day off invites and the summer film festival, are supplemental story content, adding additional context and character development. They also give a bunch of other benefits including social stat points, social link points, items and the vast majority is voiced too, making them well worth doing.

To squeeze all this in, time is going to be extremely tight, **every single day is accounted for,** and you only have **12** **spare evenings** in the entire game. You need to **follow this guide exactly**, as it will be difficult to fix any mistakes, especially for school social links. It’s recommended to save every 4 days, and make use of every save slot available, doing so will allow you to back up your save by up to 2 months.

P3R also has a new addition to the series in the form of the “Rewind” feature. It allows you to easily revisit any afternoon or evening timeslot for the previous couple of days, making it much easier to correct any mistakes on the fly without needing to go back days. It’s an amazing addition and I’d highly recommend making use of it when you need to.

To help you keep up with the guide, I’ve Included an **end-of-month checklist** for all the various things that you're going to be tracking. I've also included an in-depth breakdown of all social activities, when they happen, when they rank up etc. If you every find yourself falling behind, you can use this to quickly find the exact date of the previous rank.

P3R comes with various difficulties, but none have any effect on the story or achievements. The only difference is a very small bit of dialogue and an exclusive key item after the credits, for beating the game on merciless, so pick the difficulty that will allow you to enjoy the game the most. One thing to note about merciless difficulty is that you can only pick it at the start of the game, but you can freely drop the difficulty whenever you want. If you're worried about the game being too easy, then I'd recommend starting on merciless, you can always drop the difficulty later if you want.

I’ve included a fusion guide that you'll be working on throughout the game, following it will allow you to get 100% compendium and build powerful personas. I've included fusion paths for both DLC and non DLC personas. There are many ways to build powerful personas and while this guide won't be as specialized as some builds can be, it will have a wide variety of personas to accommodate different playstyles and party combinations. If you prefer working on your own persona builds, or are not interested in getting 100% compendium, then you can ignore this part of the guide.

I've done my best to make this guide as spoiler free as possible. Without further ado, let's jump into the game.
