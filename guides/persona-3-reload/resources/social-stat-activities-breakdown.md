### Social Stat Activities Breakdown

There are many social stat activities you can do throughout the game, some activities give more points than others, some take up time while others don't, and some are free while others cost yen. These activities are needed in order to rank up your social stats, which start at rank 1 and max out at rank 6. You'll need to level these up throughout the game to be able to access certain locations and social links. The three social stats are Courage, Charm and Academics.

This is a full breakdown of every social activity, when they happen, how many points they give, if they take up time and how much they cost.
