### Guide for the Secret Boss (Main Game)

**Set up for Elizabeth and Rules**

This is a solo fight; you still get your navigator but that's all. The fight also has some strict rules and if you break any of them, it leads Elizabeth to summon pixie and use her 9,999 Megidolaon, which will one shot you or will eat your endure/enduring soul. The rules are:

* The fight must be completed within 50 moves
* You cannot block, drain, or repel any of her attacks
* You cannot use Armageddon at the start of the fight

It’s very important not to break these rules, cause outside of breaking these rules, Elizabeth is also scripted to use her 9999 Megidolaon attack during her phase changes, and we need our Endure and Enduring Soul to tank the phase changing ones. Any rule breaking means you will use up your Endure and Enduring Soul up before the end of the fight resulting in a defeat.

Elizabeth’s three phases are:

| **Phase** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Phase 1** | 20,000 to 13,000 HP: At 13,000 HP Elizabeth will do a voice line, then summon Neibros and use Rakunda and Concentrate, before using 9,999 Megidolaon on her next turn |
| **Phase 2** | 13,000 to 10,000 HP: This phase is basically a DPS check, we have 3 turns to get Elizabeth down to 10,000 HP, otherwise she will use another 9,999 Megidolaon. It’s imperative that we hit 10,000 HP within 3 turns to skip this Megidolaon, and depending on the difficulty you are playing on this is the hardest one to do |
| **Phase 3** | Once Elizabeth hits 10,000 HP she will summon Pixie and use Heat Riser and Diarahan to heal herself back up to full health. Her attacks become more aggressive, and we need to take her back down to 10,000 HP when she will use her final scripted 9,999 Megidolaon attack |

You can see why we need to skip the phase 2 Megidolaon attack. We can only make use of  
Endure, once and Enduring soul, once. If you don’t skip the phase 2 Megidolaon you will just get insta-killed on the phase 3 Megidolaon. Now that you know the basics of the fight let's get into how we are going to set up to beat this boss.

The first thing we want to set up is our gear, it’s going to be slightly different from our normal set up:

| **Gear** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Weapon:** Lucifer’s Blade | Thanks to its +7 All stat, it will allow us to do more damage and finish the fight within the 50-turn limit |
| **Armor:** Armor of Light | Thanks to its high defence, and (high) magic damage reduction it’s our go to armor to survive Elizabeth’s multiple attacks |
| **Footwear:** Shoes of Bane | These footwears have Null Dark Instaskill, which completely negates Alice’s Die for Me attack. |
| **Accessory:** Incense Box | This accessory has the Insta-Heal skill, allowing us to recover from any status ailment. Essential for this fight has one of Elizabeth’s personas will use one random ailment every turn |

If you’ve been following the guide, you should have all these or be able to get them tomorrow from the antiques shop.

The next thing we need to set up is our persona’s, we will be needing four for this fight:

| **Persona** | **Skills** |
| --- | --- |
| **Any Persona** Can be any, this is just our starter persona for the auto skills. We will be swapping it out straight away and never using it again | Auto Tarukaja AutoRakukaja Auto Sukukaja |
| **Orpheus Telos** This is going to be our main persona, thanks to it resisting everything but not having any repels, nulls or drains. It will also be the persona to tank the phase 3 Megidolan and be our finishing persona | Diamond Dust Concentrate Heat Riser Ice Amp Regenerate 3 Firm Stance Spell Master Endure |
| **Chi You** We are going to be using this persona to make use of the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy for extra damage. He doesn't have, nulls, absorbs or repels, making him ideal for this fight. We will also be using Enduring Soul to tank the phase 1 Megidoloan | Charge Firm Stance Apt Pupil Crit Rate Amp Multi-Target Boost Slash Boost Slash Amp Enduring Soul |

If you’ve been following the fusion guide, you should have a good chunk of these skills on these personas already, the rest you should be able to teach with skill cards.

You should already have Makoto, Orpheus Telos and Chi You at level 99. If not just fight the reaper a couple of times with Armageddon Theurgy and you will easily get the EXP you need.

Next you want to level Orpheus Telos Magic, Endurance and Luck up to 99, and Chi You's Strength and Luck to 99. This allows us to do more damage while taking less damage, while luck helps with both landing and receiving crits, which is very important for the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy. The easiest way to do this is by getting incense cards from the antiques shop, the II cards give you the best bang for your back if you need to buy gemstones from Escapade to get them. Once you’re finished your personas should look like this:

Lastly make sure you have some Bead’s and Precious Eggs, 3 or 4 of each should be plenty. You will also want about 10 Debilitating Sutra’s, these can all be gotten from the Antiques Shop.

**Elizabeth’s Personas, Skills and Phase Breakdown**

Elizabeth has 9 personas that she uses, 8 of them she will use in order with the 9th being the one she will use when you break a rule or hit a phase threshold. The order will change from phase to phase.

**Phase 1**

| **Order** | **Possible Attacks** |
| --- | --- |
| 1\\. Sturt | Tarukaja Brave Blade Inferno Slash Attack |
| 2\\. Jack Frost | Concentrate Rakunda Rakukaja Diamond Dust |
| 3\\. Thor | Tarunda Thunder’s Reign God’s Hand Strike Attack |
| 4\\. Cu Chulainn | Sukukaja Charge Primal Force Panta Rhei |
| 5\\. Metatron | Sukukaja Sukunda Divine Judgement Kougaon |
| 6\\. Alice | Die for Me Eigaon |
| 7\\. Nebrios | Rakunda Random Ailment |
| 8\\. Masakado | Concentrate Megidolaon |
| 9\\. Pixie Only if you break a rule, or when you hit a phase transition | Concentrate Megidolaon Heat Riser Diarahan |

Elizabeth will start with Sturt and use 2 of the 4 skills every turn and work her way through the order until she hits Masakado, before cycling back to Sturt. Alice, Nebrios and Masakado only have 2 skills, so those attacks are always the same. Masakado’s Megidolaon is not the same as Pixie’s, it won’t hit you for 9,999. This seems like a lot, but once you start fighting her, you’ll start memorizing her order and skills.

Cause we are using an Ice build, whenever we hit Sturt, we will not only do more damage but make Elizabeth skip a persona in the order. This is very useful early in the fight. You don't want to attack Elizabeth with Diamond Dust when she has the personas Jack Frost, Alice, Nebrios or Masakado equipped, they will either null or resist the attack. Spend these turns using skills like Heat Riser, Concentrate, Charge or using a Debilitating Sutra.

> If you're having trouble remembering which personas will null or resist your Diamond Dust, you can use my previous strategy which is an Almighty build.
> 
> None of Elizabeth's personas will null or resist Almighty attacks. The build isn't as strong as this one, but it is simpler in not needing to remember which personas will null or resist your attack.
> 
> Click [Guide for the Secret Boss Almighty Build](legacy-guide-original-version-of-the-guide#guide-for-the-secret-boss) for that strategy
> 
> You don't need to Fuse Masakado for that strategy, Chi You and Masakado serve the same purpose, and Chi You is better since in doesn't reflect any attacks.
> 
> You will need to refuse Orpheus Telos though, to give it Morning Star and Almighty Boost.

To start the fight, make sure you have your auto buff persona equipped, and have both yours and Fuuka’s Theurgy’s ready to be used.

Once the fight start’s, swap straight to Orpheus Telos and use the Best Friends Theurgy. This is important for a few reasons, firstly we need to open with our Theurgy otherwise it won’t recharge in time for when we need it next. It gives us both Concentrate and Charge, plus Charge will last until we use the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy. It will also take all the rng out of Fuuka’s Theurgy.

On your next turn use Fuuka’s Theurgy, because we are already charged and focused she will give us a guaranteed Heat Riser and extended our starting buffs, then use Diamond Dust.

As Elizabeth starts with Sturt, we can get some good damage right off the bat, and force Elizabeth to skip Jack Frost, which is very useful as she can use Rakunda or Rakukaja with him.

From here you are going to be rotating between Concentrate and Diamond Dust, and maybe Heat Riser if Elizabeth decides to de-buff you. If it's just the accuracy one then I would ignore it for now, with the 99 luck you should still be able to land your hits just fine.

Once Elizabeth uses Alice, your Theurgy will be charged, switch to Chi You and use Scarlet Havoc. If you're lucky you will crit it and do around 4k damage. Switch Back to Orpheus Telos and use Heat Riser and Concentrate, you want to be fully buffed before she cycles back to Sturt. If you are fully buffed before she gets to Sturt, switch back to Chi You and use Charge. Once you see Elizabeth use Sturt, hit her with a Diamond Dust, if you got a crit with Scarlet Havoc, you should hit the Phase 2 threshold at this point by reducing her to 13,000 HP of her Max 20,000 HP.

If you didn't crit then it will take a few more attacks before you reach it, don't use your Theurgy again though, we will need it for when Elizabeth switches to phase 2.

When Elizabeth says “Magnificent! Your power is every bit as impressive as I hoped” it means you have hit the phase threshold and are about to go from phase 1 to phase 2.

**Phase 2**

| **Order** | **Possible Attacks** |
| --- | --- |
| Thor (Three Turns) | Tarunda Tarakuja Thunder’s Reign God’s Hand Strike Attack |

She will switch to Nebiros and will use Rakunda and Concentrate, you need to immediately switch to Chi You, then use a Debilitating Sutra. Elizabeth will now use her Phase 1, 9,999 Megidoloan attack, which we will tank with the Enduring Soul on Chi You, which will also restore us to full HP.

Depending on the timing, you may need to swap back to Orpheus Telos and use a Heat Riser, either because it just expired or your Theurgy isn't quite ready. As soon as you're fully buffed and have your Theurgy ready, make sure Chi You is the equipped persona and use Scarlet Havoc. If you crit you'll easily beat the DPS check, even without a crit you should still beat it on that turn.

If for some reason you don't, follow up with a Diamond Dust. Don't buff yourself, you likely don't have the moves left to buff and get an attack off. Remember we only have 3 turns to get her down to 10k HP, otherwise we fail the DPS check. If you see **Elizabeth use Concentrate and Charge you are about to fail the DPS CHECK**, you need to get her down to 10k HP on that move.

If you beat the DPS check Elizabeth will say “Marvelous ... You wield such power” then summon Pixie and use Heat Riser and heal herself back up to full hp.

**Phase 3**

| **Order** | **Possible Attacks** |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1\\. Sturt and Jack Frost | Tarunda Tarakuja Inferno | Rakunda Rakukaja Diamond Dust |
| 2\\. Thor and Cu Chulainn | Thunder Reign God’s Hand | Sukukaja Phanta Rhei Primal Force |
| 3\\. Metatron and Alice | Sukunda Divine Judgement Kougaon | Die for Me Eigaon |
| 4\\. Nebiros and Thor | Random Ailment | God’s Hand Heat Riser (Only if she lands a crit with God Hand) |
| 5\\. Jack Frost and Thor | Rakukaja Rakunda Diamond Dust | Tarunda Thunder Reign |
| 6\\. Alice and Sturt | Die for Me Eigaon | Tarukaja Brave Blade |
| 7\\. Cu Chulainn and Metatron | Sukukaja Panta Rhei Primal Force | Sukunda Divine Judgement Kougaon |
| 8\\. Alice and Masakado | Die for Me | Megidolaon |

Elizabeth really ramps up the aggression in this phase and will start using two personas every turn. It feels like a lot, and it feels far more random but there is still a pattern to it. With this build you will easily be able to withstand the onslaught of attacks, the 99 endurance and Firm Stance on Orpheus Telos nearly allows Regenerate 3 to fully restore the HP lost each time, you will only lose chip damage. As a result, we are through the hardest part of the fight. Phase 3 turns into a fight of attrition, Elizabeth will buff and de-buff a lot in this phase.

The Strategy in Phase 3 is basically the same as Phase 1. Buff yourself with Concentrate and Heat Riser, de-buff Elizabeth when you can, hit Elizabeth with Diamond Dust when you're fully buffed, and try to get this to sync up for when Elizabeth has sturt equipped, its number 6 in this new order. Make sure not to attack when Elizabeth has Jack Frost, Alice, Nebrios or Masakado equipped, as these personas will resist or null the attack. When you can switch to Chi You to use Charge, so you can use Scarlet Havoc again when the Theurgy is ready to go. You can switch to Chi You whenever suits you, just not when Elizabeth is about to use Thor, as Chi You is weak to electricity.

Hitting Sturt with Diamond Dust, sometimes does something weird with the order for 7 and 8. Sometimes she will go Cu Chulainn and Masakado, then cycle back to the start. Other times Elizabeth will go Cu Chulainn and Masakado, and then Alice and Masakado, before cycling back to the start. It doesn't make a lot of difference, but it's something to be aware of.

How many times you can use Scarlet Havoc depends on if you get crits or not. If you crit the first time I wouldn't risk a second one, If you don't crit the first one, then you should be good to go for a second one, even if it crits. Just be careful using Scarlet Havoc when Elizabeth is under 15k HP. If you crit when she is under this HP, you'll likely take her under 10k HP and trigger her phase 3 Megidoloan, which you don't want to happen just as you used your Theurgy.

Once Elizabeth is under 15k HP, you want to have a full Theurgy ready to use, and take her down to 10k HP with Concentrate, Heat Riser, Debilitating Sutra's and Diamond Dust.

The moment Elizabeth hits 10K HP, Elizabeth will say "now it's time for the grand finale" and will use her phase 3 Megidoloan, which we will tank with Endure on Orpheus Telos. You need to finish the fight on the next move with the Armageddon Theurgy, if you don't Elizabeth will heal herself to full HP and hit you with another 9,999 Megidoloan.

If you use Armageddon here, you will finish the fight. Congratulations you just beat the hardest boss in the game.

> **Important! Important!  
> **This strategy was designed with merciless in mind. The damage you can do on lower difficulties is going to be significantly higher, which means you will hit the phase thresholds much faster than what I say here.
> 
> If you find yourself doing too much damage, trying doing the fight without the Scarlet Havoc Theurgy and just focus on buffing, de-buffing and Diamond Dust.
